Wherever that great heart may now be<br/>

Captain of the main-top in the year 1843<br/>
in the U. S. Frigate &ldquo;United States.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The year 1797, the year of this narrative, belongs to a period<br/>
which as every thinker now feels, involved a crisis for Christen-<br/>
dom not exceeded in its undetermined momentousness at the<br/>
time by any other era whereof there is record. The opening<br/>
proposition made by the Spirit of that Age, involved the rectification of the Old World's hereditary wrongs. In France to some<br/>
extent this was bloodily effected. But what then? Straightway the<br/>
Revolution itself became a wrongdoer, one more oppressive than<br/>
the kings. Under Napoleon it enthroned upstart kings, and initi-<br/>
ated that prolonged agony of continual war whose final throe was<br/>
Waterloo. During those years not the wisest could have foreseen<br/>
that the outcome of all would be what to some thinkers ap-<br/>
parently it has since turned out to be, a political advance along<br/>
nearly the whole line for Europeans.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, as elsewhere hinted, it was something caught from the<br/>
Revolutionary Spirit that at Spithead emboldened the man-of-<br/>
war's men to rise against real abuses, long-standing ones, and<br/>
afterwards at the Nore to make inordinate and aggressive de-<br/>
mands, successful resistance to which was confirmed only when<br/>
the ringleaders were hung for an admonitory spectacle to the<br/>
anchored fleet. Yet in a way analogous to the operation of the<br/>
Revolution at large the Great Mutiny, though by Englishmen <br/>
naturally deemed monstrous at the time, doubtless gave the first<br/>
latent prompting to most important reforms in the British Navy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the time before steamships, or then more frequently than now,<br/>
a stroller along the docks of any considerable seaport would<br/>
occasionally have his attention arrested by a group of bronzed<br/>
mariners, man-of-war's men or merchant-sailors in holiday attire<br/>
ashore on liberty. In certain instances they would flank, or, like<br/>
a body-guard quite surround some superior figure of their own<br/>
class, moving along with them like Aldebaran among the lesser<br/>
lights of his constellation. That signal object was the &ldquo;Handsome<br/>
Sailor&rdquo; of the less prosaic time alike of the military and merchant<br/>
navies. With no perceptible trace of the vainglorious about him, <br/>
rather with the off-hand unaffectedness of natural regality, he<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
seemed to accept the spontaneous homage of his shipmates. A<br/>
somewhat remarkable instance recurs to me. In Liverpool, now<br/>
half a century ago I saw under the shadow of the great dingy<br/>
street-wall of Prince's Dock (an obstruction long since removed)<br/>
a common sailor, so intensely black that he must needs have been<br/>
a native African of the unadulterate blood of Ham. A sym-<br/>
metric figure much above the average height. The two ends of a<br/>
gay silk handkerchief thrown loose about the neck danced upon<br/>
the displayed ebony of his chest; in his ears were big hoops of<br/>
gold, and a Scotch Highland bonnet with a tartan band set<br/>
off his shapely head.<br/>
<br/>
It was a hot noon in July; and his face, lustrous with per-<br/>
spiration, beamed with barbaric good humor. In jovial sallies<br/>
right and left his white teeth flashing into view, he rollicked<br/>
along, the center of a company of his shipmates. These were made<br/>
up of such an assortment of tribes and complexions as would<br/>
have well fitted them to be marched up by Anacharsis Cloots<br/>
before the bar of the first French Assembly as Representatives of<br/>
the Human Race. At each spontaneous tribute rendered by the<br/>
wayfarers to this black pagod of a fellow&mdash;the tribute of a<br/>
pause and stare, and less frequent an exclamation,&mdash;the motley<br/>
retinue showed that they took that sort of pride in the evoker of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
it which the Assyrian priests doubtless showed for their grand<br/>
sculptured Bull when the faithful prostrated themselves.<br/>
<br/>
To return.<br/>
<br/>
If in some cases a bit of a nautical Murat in setting forth his<br/>
person ashore, the handsome sailor of the period in question<br/>
evinced nothing of the dandified Billy-be-Damn, an amusing<br/>
character all but extinct now, but occasionally to be encountered,<br/>
and in a form yet more amusing than the original, at the tiller of<br/>
the boats on the tempestuous Erie Canal or, more likely, vaporing<br/>
in the groggeries along the tow-path. Invariably a proficient in his<br/>
perilous calling, he was also more or less of a mighty boxer or<br/>
wrestler. It was strength and beauty. Tales of his prowess were<br/>
recited. Ashore he was the champion; afloat the spokesman; on<br/>
every suitable occasion always foremost. Close-reefing topsails<br/>
in a gale, there he was, astride the weather yard-arm-end, foot in<br/>
the Flemish horse as &ldquo;stirrup,&rdquo; both hands tugging at the &ldquo;ear-<br/>
ring&rdquo; as at a bridle, in very much the attitude of young Alexan-<br/>
der curbing the fiery Bucephalus. A superb figure, tossed up as by<br/>
the horns of Taurus against the thunderous sky, cheerily hallooing<br/>
to the strenuous file along the spar.<br/>
<br/>
The moral nature was seldom out of keeping with the physical<br/>
make. Indeed, except as toned by the former, the comeliness and<br/>
power, always attractive in masculine conjunction, hardly could<br/>
have drawn the sort of honest homage the Handsome Sailor in<br/>
some examples received from his less gifted associates.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Such a cynosure, at least in aspect, and something such too in <br/>
nature, though with important variations made apparent as the<br/>
story proceeds, was welkin-eyed Billy Budd, or Baby Budd as<br/>
more familiarly under circumstances hereafter to be given he at<br/>
last came to be called aged twenty-one, a foretopman of the<br/>
British fleet toward the close of the last decade of the eighteenth<br/>
century. It was not very long prior to the time of the narration<br/>
that follows that he had entered the King's Service, having been<br/>
impressed on the Narrow Seas from a homeward-bound English<br/>
merchantman into a seventy-four outward-bound, H.M.S. Indomi-<br/>
table; which ship, as was not unusual in those hurried days had<br/>
been obliged to put to sea short of her proper complement of men.<br/>
Plump upon Billy at first sight in the gangway the boarding<br/>
officer Lieutenant Ratcliffe pounced, even before the merchant-<br/>
man's crew formally was mustered on the quarter-deck for his<br/>
deliberate inspection. And him only he elected. For whether it<br/>
was because the other men when ranged before him showed to<br/>
ill advantage after Billy, or whether he had some scruples in view<br/>
of the merchantman being rather short-handed, however it might<br/>
be, the officer contented himself with his first spontaneous choice.<br/>
To the surprise of the ship's company, though much to the Lieu-<br/>
tenant's satisfaction Billy made no demur. But, indeed, any<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
demur would have been as idle as the protest of a goldfinch<br/>
popped into a cage.<br/>
<br/>
Noting his uncomplaining acquiescence, all but cheerful one<br/>
might say, the shipmates turned a surprised glance of silent<br/>
reproach at the sailor. The shipmaster was one of those worthy<br/>
mortals found in every vocation even the humbler ones &mdash;the sort<br/>
of person whom everybody agrees in calling &ldquo;a respectable man.&rdquo;<br/>
And&mdash;nor so strange to report as it may appear to be&mdash;though a<br/>
ploughman of the troubled waters, life-long contending with the<br/>
intractable elements, there was nothing this honest soul at heart<br/>
loved better than simple peace and quiet. For the rest, he was<br/>
fifty or thereabouts, a little inclined to corpulence, a prepossessing<br/>
face, unwhiskered, and of an agreeable color&mdash;a rather full face, <br/>
humanely intelligent in expression. On a fair day with a fair wind<br/>
and all going well, a certain musical chime in his voice seemed to<br/>
be the veritable unobstructed outcome of the innermost man. He<br/>
had much prudence, much conscientiousness, and there were<br/>
occasions when these virtues were the cause of overmuch disquie-<br/>
tude in him. On a passage, so long as his craft was in any proxim-<br/>
ity to land, no sleep for Captain Graveling. He took to heart those<br/>
serious responsibilities not so heavily borne by some shipmasters.<br/>
<br/>
Now while Billy Budd was down in the forecastle getting his<br/>
kit together, the Indomitable's lieutenant, burly and bluff, nowise<br/>
disconcerted by Captain Graveling's omitting to proffer the cus-<br/>
tomary hospitalities on an occasion so unwelcome to him, an<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
omission simply caused by preoccupation of thought, unceremoni-<br/>
ously invited himself into the cabin, and also to a flask from the<br/>
spirit-locker, a receptacle which his experienced eye instantly<br/>
discovered. In fact he was one of those sea-dogs in whom all the<br/>
hardship and peril of naval life in the great prolonged wars of his<br/>
time never impaired the natural instinct for sensuous enjoyment.<br/>
His duty he always faithfully did; but duty is sometimes a dry<br/>
obligation, and he was for irrigating its aridity whensoever<br/>
possible with a fertilizing decoction of strong waters. For the<br/>
cabin's proprietor there was nothing left but to play the part of<br/>
the enforced host with whatever grace and alacrity were practi-<br/>
cable. As necessary adjuncts to the flask, he silently placed tumbler<br/>
and water-jug before the irrepressible guest. But excusing himself<br/>
from partaking just then, he dismally watched the unembar-<br/>
rassed officer deliberately diluting his grog a little, then tossing<br/>
it off in three swallows, pushing the empty tumbler away, yet not<br/>
so far as to be beyond easy reach, at the same time settling<br/>
himself in his seat and smacking his lips with high satisfaction,<br/>
looking straight at the host.<br/>
<br/>
These proceedings over, the Master broke the silence; and<br/>
there lurked a rueful reproach in the tone of his voice; &ldquo;Lieu-<br/>
tenant, you are going to take my best man from me, the jewel of<br/>
'em.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Yes, I know&rdquo; rejoined the other, immediately drawing back<br/>
the tumbler preliminary to a replenishing; &ldquo;Yes I know. Sorry.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Beg pardon, but you don't understand, Lieutenant. See here<br/>
now. Before I shipped that young fellow, my forecastle was a <br/>
rat-pit of quarrels. It was black times, I tell you, aboard the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lsquo; Rights&rsquo; here. I was worried to that degree my pipe had no com-<br/>
fort for me. But Billy came; and it was like a Catholic priest<br/>
striking peace in an Irish shindy. Not that he preached to<br/>
them or said or did anything in particular; but a virtue went out<br/>
of him, sugaring the sour ones. They took to him like hornets to<br/>
treacle; all but the bluffer of the gang, the big shaggy chap with<br/>
the fire-red whiskers. He indeed out of envy, perhaps, of the new-<br/>
comer, and thinking such a &lsquo;sweet and pleasant fellow&rsquo;, as he<br/>
mockingly designated him to the others, could hardly have the<br/>
spirit of a game-cock, must needs bestir himself in trying to get up<br/>
an ugly row with him. Billy forebore with him and reasoned with<br/>
him in a pleasant way&mdash;he is something like myself, lieutenant,<br/>
to whom aught like a quarrel is hateful&mdash;but nothing served. So,<br/>
in the second dog-watch one day the Red Whiskers in presence<br/>
of the others, under pretence of showing Billy just whence a<br/>
sirloin steak was cut&mdash;for the fellow had once been a butcher&mdash;<br/>
insultingly gave him a dig under the ribs. Quick as lightning<br/>
Billy let fly his arm. I dare say he never meant to do quite as<br/>
much as he did, but anyhow he gave the burly fool a terrible<br/>
drubbing. It took about half a minute, I should think. And, Lord<br/>
bless you, the lubber was astonished at the celerity. And will you<br/>
believe it, Lieutenant, the Red Whiskers now really loves Billy&mdash;<br/>
loves him, or is the biggest hypocrite that ever I heard of. But they<br/>
all love him. Some of 'em do his washing, darn his old trousers<br/>
for him; the carpenter is at odd times making a pretty little chest<br/>
of drawers for him. Anybody will do anything for Billy Budd; <br/>
and it's the happy family here. But now Lieutenant, if that young<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
fellow goes&mdash;I know how it will be aboard the &lsquo; Rights.&rsquo; Not again<br/>
very soon shall I, coming up from dinner, lean over the capstan<br/>
smoking a quiet pipe&mdash;no, not very soon again, I think. Ay, Lieu-<br/>
tenant, you are going to take away the jewel of 'em; you are going<br/>
to take away my peacemaker!&rdquo; And with that the good soul had<br/>
really some ado in checking a rising sob.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the officer who had listened with amused<br/>
interest to all this, and now waxing merry with his tipple; &ldquo;Well, blessed<br/>
are the peacemakers especially the fighting peacemakers! And<br/>
such are the seventy-four beauties some of which you see poking<br/>
their noses out of the port-holes of yonder warship lying-to for me&rdquo;<br/>
pointing through the cabin window of the Indomitable. &ldquo;But<br/>
courage! don't look so downhearted, man. Why, I pledge you in<br/>
advance the royal approbation. Rest assured that His Majesty<br/>
will be delighted to know that in a time when his hardtack is not<br/>
sought for by sailors with such avidity as should be; a time also<br/>
when some shipmasters privily resent the borrowing from them<br/>
a tar or two for the service; His Majesty, I say, will be delighted<br/>
to learn that one shipmaster at least cheerfully surrenders to the<br/>
King, the flower of his flock, a sailor who with equal loyalty<br/>
makes no dissent. &mdash;But where's my beauty? Ah,&rdquo; looking through<br/>
the cabin's open door &ldquo;Here he comes; and, by Jove&mdash;lugging<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
along his chest &mdash;Apollo with his portmanteau!&mdash;My man,&rdquo;<br/>
stepping out to him, &ldquo;you can't take that big box on board a war-<br/>
ship. The boxes there are mostly shot-boxes. Put your duds in a<br/>
bag, lad. Boot and saddle for the cavalryman, bag and ham-<br/>
mock for the man-of-war's man.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
The transfer from chest to bag was made. And, after seeing<br/>
his man into the cutter and then following him down, the lieu-<br/>
tenant pushed off from the Rights-of-Man. That was the mer-<br/>
chant ship's name; though by her master and crew abbreviated in<br/>
sailor fashion into The Rights. The hard-headed Dundee owner<br/>
was a staunch admirer of Thomas Paine whose book in rejoin-<br/>
der to Burke's arraignment of the French Revolution had then<br/>
been published for some time and had gone everywhere. In chris-<br/>
tening his vessel after the title of Paine's volume the man of<br/>
Dundee was something like his contemporary shipowner, Stephen<br/>
Girard of Philadelphia, whose sympathies, alike with his native<br/>
land and its liberal philosophers, he evinced by naming his ships<br/>
after Voltaire, Diderot, and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
But now, when the boat swept under the merchant man's<br/>
stern, and officer and oarsmen were noting &mdash;some bitterly and<br/>
others with a grin,&mdash; the name emblazoned there; just then it<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
was that the new recruit jumped up from the bow where the<br/>
coxswain had directed him to sit, and waving his hat to his<br/>
silent shipmates sorrowfully looking over at him from the taffrail,<br/>
bade the lads a genial good-bye. Then making a salutation as<br/>
to the ship herself, &ldquo;And good-bye to you too, old, Rights of<br/>
Man!&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Down, Sir!&rdquo; roared the lieutenant, instantly assuming all the<br/>
rigor of his rank, though with difficulty repressing a smile.<br/>
<br/>
To be sure, Billy's action was a terrible breach of naval decorum.<br/>
But in that decorum he had never been instructed; in considera-<br/>
tion of which the lieutenant would hardly have been so energetic<br/>
in reproof but for the concluding farewell to the ship. This he<br/>
rather took as meant to convey a covert sally on the new recruit's<br/>
part, a sly slur at impressment in general, and that of himself in<br/>
especial. And yet, more likely, if satire it was in effect, it was<br/>
hardly so by intention, for Billy, though happily endowed with the<br/>
gaiety of high health, youth and a free heart, was yet by no means<br/>
of a satirical turn. The will to it and the sinister dexterity were<br/>
alike wanting. To deal in double meaning and insinuations of<br/>
any sort was quite foreign to his nature.<br/>
<br/>
As to his enforced enlistment, that he seemed to take pretty<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
much as he was wont to take any vicissitude of weather. Like<br/>
the animals, though no philosopher, he was, without knowing it,<br/>
practically a fatalist. And, it may be, that he rather liked this<br/>
adventurous turn in his affairs, which promised an opening into<br/>
novel scenes and martial excitements.<br/>
<br/>
Aboard the Indomitable our merchant-sailor was forthwith<br/>
rated as an able-seaman and assigned to the starboard watch of<br/>
the foretop. He was soon at home in the service, not at all disliked<br/>
for his unpretentious good looks and a sort of genial happy-go-<br/>
lucky air. No merrier man in his mess: in marked contrast to<br/>
certain other individuals included like himself among the im-<br/>
pressed portions of the ship's company; for these when not ac-<br/>
tively employed were sometimes, and more particularly in the<br/>
last dog-watch when the drawing near of twilight induced<br/>
revery, apt to fall into a saddish mood which in some partook of<br/>
sullenness. But they were not so young as our foretopman, and no<br/>
few of them must have known a hearth of some sort, others may<br/>
have had wives and children left, too probably, in uncertain cir-<br/>
cumstances, and hardly any but must have acknowledged kith<br/>
and kin, while for Billy, as will shortly be seen, his entire family<br/>
was practically invested in himself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Though our new-made foretopman was well received in the top<br/>
and on the gun-decks, hardly here was he that cynosure he had<br/>
previously been among those minor ship's companies of the mer-<br/>
chant marine, with which companies only had he hitherto con-<br/>
sorted.<br/>
<br/>
He was young; and despite his all but fully developed frame in<br/>
aspect looked even younger than he really was, owing to a linger-<br/>
ing adolescent expression in the as yet smooth face all but femi-<br/>
nine in purity in natural complexion but where, thanks to his<br/>
seagoing, the lily was quite suppressed and the rose had some ado<br/>
visibly to flush through the tan.<br/>
<br/>
To one essentially such a novice in the complexities of fact-<br/>
ious life, the abrupt transition from his former and simpler sphere<br/>
to the ampler and more knowing world of a great warship; this<br/>
might well have abashed him had there been any conceit or vanity<br/>
in his composition. Among her miscellaneous multitude, the<br/>
Indomitable mustered several individuals who however inferior<br/>
in grade were of no common natural stamp, sailors more signally<br/>
susceptive of that air which continuous martial discipline and<br/>
repeated presence in battle can in some degree impart even to<br/>
the average man. As the handsome sailor Billy Budd's position<br/>
aboard the seventy-four was something analogous to that of a<br/>
rustic beauty transplanted from the provinces and brought into<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
competition with the high-born dames of the court. But this<br/>
change of circumstances he scarce noted. As little did he observe<br/>
that something about him provoked an ambiguous smile in one<br/>
or two harder faces among the blue-jackets. Nor less unaware<br/>
was he of the peculiar favorable effect his person and demeanor<br/>
had upon the more intelligent gentlemen of the quarter-deck. <br/>
Nor could this well have been otherwise. Cast in a mould peculiar<br/>
to the finest physical examples of those Englishmen in whom the<br/>
Saxon strain would seem not at all to partake of any Norman or<br/>
other admixture, he showed in face that humane look of repose-<br/>
ful good nature which the Greek sculptor in some instances gave<br/>
to his heroic strong man, Hercules. But this again was subtly<br/>
modified by another and pervasive quality. The ear, small and<br/>
shapely, the arch of the foot, the curve in mouth and nostril, even<br/>
the indurated hand dyed to the orange-tawny of the toucan's bill,<br/>
a hand telling alike of the halyards and tar-bucket; but, above<br/>
all, something in the mobile expression, and every chance attitude<br/>
and movement, something suggestive of a mother eminently<br/>
favored by Love and the Graces; all this strangely indicated a<br/>
lineage in direct contradiction to his lot. The mysteriousness<br/>
here, became less mysterious through a matter-of-fact elicited<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
when Billy at the capstan was being formally mustered into the<br/>
service. Asked by the officer, a small brisk little gentleman as it<br/>
chanced among other questions, his place of birth, he replied,<br/>
&ldquo;Please, Sir, I don't know.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Don't know where you were born?&mdash;-Who was your<br/>
father? &lt;&rdquo;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;God knows, Sir.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
Struck by the straightforward simplicity of these replies, the<br/>
officer next asked &ldquo;Do you know anything about your beginning?&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;No, Sir. But I have heard that I was found in a pretty silk-lined<br/>
basket hanging one morning from the knocker of a good man's<br/>
door in Bristol &lt;.&gt;&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo; Found say you? Well,&rdquo; throwing back his head and looking up<br/>
and down the new recruit; &ldquo;Well it turns out to have been a pretty<br/>
good find. Hope they'll find some more like you, my man; the fleet<br/>
sadly needs them.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Billy Budd was a foundling, a presumable bye-blow, and,<br/>
evidently, no ignoble one. Noble descent was as evident in him<br/>
as in a blood horse.<br/>
<br/>
For the rest, with little or no sharpness of faculty or any trace of<br/>
the wisdom of the serpent, nor yet quite a dove, he possessed<br/>
that kind and degree of intelligence going along with the uncon-<br/>
ventional rectitude of a sound human creature, one to whom not<br/>
yet has been proffered the questionable apple of knowledge. He<br/>
was illiterate; he could not read, but he could sing, and like the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
illiterate nightingale was sometimes the composer of his own<br/>
song.<br/>
<br/>
Of self-consciousness he seemed to have little or none, or<br/>
about as much as we may reasonably impute to a dog of St.<br/>
Bernard's breed.<br/>
<br/>
Habitually being with the elements and knowing little more of<br/>
the land than as a beach, or, rather, that portion of the terraqueous<br/>
globe providentially set apart for dance-houses doxies and tap-<br/>
sters, in short what sailors call a &ldquo;fiddlers' green,&rdquo; his simple<br/>
nature remained unsophisticated by those moral obliquities<br/>
which are not in every case incompatible with that manufacturable<br/>
thing known as respectability. But are sailors, frequenters of<br/>
&ldquo;fiddlers' greens&rdquo;, without vices? No; but less often than with<br/>
landsmen do their vices, so called, partake of crookedness of<br/>
heart, seeming less to proceed from viciousness than exuber-<br/>
ance of vitality after long constraint; frank manifestations in ac-<br/>
cordance with natural law. By his original constitution aided by<br/>
the co&ouml;perating influences of his lot, Billy in many respects, was<br/>
little more than a sort of upright barbarian, much such perhaps<br/>
as Adam presumably might have been ere the urbane Serpent<br/>
wriggled himself into his company.<br/>
<br/>
And here be it submitted that apparently going to corroborate<br/>
the doctrine of man's fall, a doctrine now popularly ignored, it<br/>
is observable that where certain virtues pristine and unadulterate<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
peculiarly characterize anybody in the external uniform of civi-<br/>
lization, they will upon scrutiny seem not to be derived from<br/>
custom or convention but rather to be out of keeping with these, <br/>
as if indeed exceptionally transmitted from a period prior to<br/>
Cain's city and citified man. The character marked by such quali-<br/>
ties has to an unvitiated taste an untampered-with flavor like<br/>
that of berries while the man thoroughly civilized even in a fair<br/>
specimen of the breed has to the same moral palate a question-<br/>
able smack as of a compounded wine. To any stray inheritor of<br/>
these primitive qualities found, like Caspar Hauser, wandering<br/>
dazed in any Christian capital of our time the good-natured <br/>
poet's famous invocation, near two thousand years ago, of the<br/>
good rustic out of his latitude in the Rome of the Caesars, still<br/>
appropriately holds:&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Honest and poor, faithful in word and thought,What has Thee, Fabian, to the city brought.&rdquo; Though our Handsome Sailor had as much of masculine beauty<br/>
as one can expect anywhere to see; nevertheless, like the beauti-<br/>
ful woman in one of Hawthorne's minor tales, there was just one<br/>
thing amiss in him. No visible blemish, indeed, as with the lady;<br/>
no, but an occasional liability to a vocal defect. Though in the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
hour of elemental uproar or peril, he was everything that a sailor<br/>
should be, yet under sudden provocation of strong heart-feeling<br/>
his voice otherwise singularly musical, as if expressive of the<br/>
harmony within, was apt to develop an organic hesitancy, in<br/>
fact more or less of a stutter or even worse. In this particular<br/>
Billy was a striking instance that the arch interferer, the envious<br/>
marplot of Eden still has more or less to do with every human<br/>
consignment to this planet of earth. In every case, one way or an-<br/>
other he is sure to slip in his little card, as much as to remind us&mdash;<br/>
I too have a hand here.<br/>
<br/>
The avowal of such an imperfection in the Handsome Sailor<br/>
should be evidence not alone that he is not presented as a con-<br/>
ventional hero, but also that the story in which he is the main<br/>
figure is no romance.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At the time of Billy Budd's arbitrary enlistment into the In-<br/>
domitable that ship was on her way to join the Mediterranean<br/>
fleet. No long time elapsed before the junction was effected. As<br/>
one of that fleet the seventy-four participated in its movements,<br/>
though at times on account of her superior sailing qualities, in<br/>
the absence of frigates, despatched on separate duty as a scout<br/>
and at times on less temporary service. But with all this the<br/>
story has little concernment, restricted as it is to the inner life<br/>
of one particular ship and the career of an individual sailor.<br/>
<br/>
It was the summer of 1797. In the April of that year had oc-<br/>
curred the commotion at Spithead followed in May by a second<br/>
and yet more serious outbreak in the fleet at the Nore. The latter<br/>
is known, and without exaggeration in the epithet, as the Great<br/>
Mutiny. It was indeed a demonstration more menacing to England<br/>
than the contemporary manifestoes and conquering and proselyt-<br/>
ing armies of the French Directory.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To the British Empire the Nore Mutiny was what a strike in<br/>
the fire-brigade would be to London threatened by general arson.<br/>
In a crisis when the Kingdom might well have anticipated the<br/>
famous signal that some years later published along the naval <br/>
line of battle what it was that upon occasion England expected of<br/>
Englishmen; that was the time when at the mast-heads of the<br/>
three-deckers and seventy-fours moored in her own roadstead&mdash;<br/>
a fleet, the right arm of a Power then all but the sole free conserva-<br/>
tive one of the Old World, the blue-jackets, to be numbered by<br/>
thousands, ran up with hurras the British colors with the union<br/>
and cross wiped out; by that cancellation transmuting the flag of<br/>
founded law and freedom defined, into the enemy's red meteor of<br/>
unbridled and unbounded revolt. Reasonable discontent grow-<br/>
ing out of practical grievances in the fleet had been ignited into<br/>
irrational combustion as by live cinders blown across the Channel<br/>
from France in flames.<br/>
<br/>
The event converted into irony for a time those spirited strains<br/>
of Dibdin&mdash;as a song-writer no mean auxiliary to the English<br/>
Government at the European conjuncture&mdash;strains celebrating,<br/>
among other things, the patriotic devotion of the British tar:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;And as for my life, 'tis the King's!&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
Such an episode in the Island's grand naval story her naval<br/>
historians naturally abridge; one of them (G. P. R. James) can-<br/>
didly acknowledging that fain would he pass it over did not &ldquo;im-<br/>
partiality forbid fastidiousness.&rdquo; And yet his mention is less a<br/>
narration than a reference, having to do hardly at all with details.<br/>

At all events, of these thousands of mutineers were some of the<br/>
tars who not so very long afterwards &mdash;whether wholly <br/>
prompted thereto by patriotism, or pugnacious instinct, or by<br/>
both,&mdash;helped to win a coronet for Nelson at the Nile, and the<br/>
naval crown of crowns for him at Trafalgar. To the mutineers<br/>
those battles and especially Trafalgar were a plenary absolution;<br/>
and a grand one; for all that goes to make up scenic naval display<br/>
and heroic magnificence in arms. Those battles especially Trafal-<br/>
gar stand unmatched in human annals.<br/>

Concerning &ldquo;The greatest sailor since the<br/>

<br/>
In this matter of writing, resolve as one may to keep to the<br/>
main road, some bypaths have an enticement not readily to be<br/>
withstood. I am going to err into such a bypath. If the reader<br/>
will keep me company I shall be glad. At the least we can promise<br/>
ourselves that pleasure which is wickedly said to be in sinning,<br/>
for a literary sin the divergence will be.<br/>
<br/>
Very likely it is no new remark that the inventions of our time<br/>
have at last brought about a change in sea-warfare in degree cor-<br/>
responding to the revolution in all warfare affected by the original<br/>
introduction from China into Europe of gunpowder. The first<br/>
European fire-arm, a clumsy contrivance, was, as is well known,<br/>
scouted by no few of the knights as a base implement good<br/>
enough peradventure for weavers too craven to stand up crossing<br/>
steel with steel in frank fight. But as ashore knightly valor though<br/>
shorn of its blazonry did not cease with the knights, neither on the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
seas though nowadays in encounters there a certain kind of dis-<br/>
played gallantry be fallen out of date as hardly applicable under <br/>
changed circumstances, did the nobler qualities of such naval<br/>
magnates as Don John of Austria, Doria, Van Tromp, Jean Bart,<br/>
the long line of British admirals and the American Decaturs of<br/>
1812 become obsolete with their wooden walls.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, to anybody who can hold the Present at its worth<br/>
without being inappreciative of the Past, it may be forgiven, if to<br/>
such a one the solitary old hulk at Portsmouth, Nelson's Victory,<br/>
seems to float there, not alone as the decaying monument of a<br/>
fame incorruptible, but also as a poetic reproach, softened by its<br/>
picturesqueness, to the Monitors and yet mightier hulls of the<br/>
European iron-clads. And this not altogether because such<br/>
craft are unsightly, unavoidably lacking the symmetry and<br/>
grand lines of the old battleships, but equally for other reasons.<br/>
<br/>
There are some, perhaps, who while not altogether inacces-<br/>
sible to that poetic reproach just alluded to, may yet on behalf<br/>
of the new order, be disposed to parry it; and this to the extent<br/>
of iconoclasm, if need be. For example, prompted by the sight<br/>
of the star inserted in the Victory's quarter-deck designating the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
spot where the Great Sailor fell, these martial utilitarians <br/>
may suggest considerations implying that Nelson's ornate publica-<br/>
tion of his person in battle was not only unnecessary, but not<br/>
military, nay, savored of foolhardiness and vanity. They may add,<br/>
too, that at Trafalgar it was in effect nothing less than a chal-<br/>
lenge to death; and death came; and that but for his bravado<br/>
the victorious admiral might possibly have survived the battle,<br/>
and so, instead of having his sagacious dying injunction over-<br/>
ruled by his immediate successor in command he himself when<br/>
the contest was decided might have brought his shattered fleet<br/>
to anchor, a proceeding which might have averted the deplor-<br/>
able loss of life by shipwreck in the elemental tempest that fol-<br/>
lowed the martial one.<br/>
<br/>
Well, should we set aside the more disputable point whether<br/>
for various reasons it was possible to anchor the fleet, then plau-<br/>
sibly enough the Benthamites of war may urge the above.<br/>
<br/>
But the might have been is but boggy ground to build on. And<br/>
certainly in foresight as to the larger issue of an encounter, and<br/>
anxious preparation for it&mdash;buoying the deadly way and map-<br/>
ping it out, as at Copenhagen&mdash;few commanders have been so<br/>
painstakingly circumspect as this same reckless declarer of his<br/>
person in fight.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Personal prudence even when dictated by quite other than<br/>
selfish considerations is surely no special virtue in a military man;<br/>
while an excessive love of glory, impassioning a less burning<br/>
impulse the honest sense of duty, is the first. If the name Wel-<br/>
lington is not so much a trumpet to the blood as the simpler name<br/>
Nelson, the reason for this may perhaps be inferred from the<br/>
above. Alfred in his funeral ode on the victor of Waterloo ven-<br/>
tures not to call him the greatest soldier of all time, though in the<br/>
same ode he invokes Nelson as &ldquo;the greatest sailor since the world<br/>
began.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
At Trafalgar Nelson on the brink of opening the fight sat down<br/>
and wrote his last brief will and testament. If under the pre-<br/>
sentiment of the most magnificent of all victories to be crowned<br/>
by his own glorious death, a sort of priestly motive led him to<br/>
dress his person in the jewelled vouchers of his own shining deeds;<br/>
if thus to have adorned himself for the altar and the sacrifice were<br/>
indeed vainglory, then affectation and fustian is each more he-<br/>
roic line in the great epics and dramas, since in such lines the<br/>
poet but embodies in verse those exaltations of sentiment that<br/>
a nature like Nelson, the opportunity being given, vitalizes into<br/>
acts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the outbreak at the Nore was put down. But not every<br/>
grievance was redressed. If the contractors, for example, were no<br/>
longer permitted to ply some practices peculiar to their tribe<br/>
everywhere, such as providing shoddy cloth, rations not sound, or<br/>
false in the measure; not the less impressment, for one thing,<br/>
went on. By custom sanctioned for centuries, and judicially main-<br/>
tained by a Lord Chancellor as late as Mansfield, that mode of<br/>
manning the fleet, a mode now fallen into a sort of abeyance but<br/>
never formally renounced, it was not practicable to give up in<br/>
those years. Its abrogation would have crippled the indispen-<br/>
sable fleet, one wholly under canvas, no steam-power, its innu-<br/>
merable sails and thousands of cannon, everything in short,<br/>
worked by muscle alone; a fleet the more insatiate in demand for<br/>
men, because then multiplying its ship&lt;s&gt; of all grades against<br/>
contingencies present and to come of the convulsed Continent.<br/>
<br/>
Discontent foreran the Two Mutinies, and more or less it lur-<br/>
kingly survived them. Hence it was not unreasonable to appre-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
hend some return of trouble sporadic or general. One instance<br/>
of such apprehensions: In the same year with this story, Nelson,<br/>
then Vice-Admiral Sir Horatio, being with the fleet off the Span-<br/>
ish coast, was directed by the Admiral in command to shift his<br/>
pennant from the Captain to the Theseus; and for this reason: that<br/>
the latter ship having newly arrived in the station from home<br/>
where it had taken part in the Great Mutiny, danger was appre-<br/>
hended from the temper of the men; and it was thought that<br/>
an officer like Nelson was the one, not indeed to terrorize the<br/>
crew into base subjection, but to win them, by force of his mere<br/>
presence back to an allegiance if not as enthusiastic as his own,<br/>
yet as true. So it was that for a time on more than one quarter-<br/>
deck anxiety did exist. At sea precautionary vigilance was strained<br/>
against relapse. At short notice an engagement might come on.<br/>
When it did, the lieutenants assigned to batteries felt it incum-<br/>
bent on them, in some instances to stand with drawn swords<br/>
behind the men working the guns.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But on board the seventy-four in which Billy now swung his<br/>
hammock, very little in the manner of the men and nothing ob-<br/>
vious in the demeanor of the officers would have suggested to<br/>
an ordinary observer that the Great Mutiny was a recent event.<br/>
In their general bearing and conduct the commissioned officers of<br/>
a warship naturally take their tone from the commander, that is<br/>
if he has that ascendancy of character that ought to be his.<br/>
<br/>
Captain the Honorable Edward Fairfax Vere, to give his full<br/>
title, was a bachelor of forty or thereabouts, a sailor of distinc-<br/>
tion even in a time prolific of renowned seamen. Though allied<br/>
to the higher nobility his advancement had not been altogether<br/>
owing to influences connected with that circumstance. He had<br/>
seen much service, been in various engagements, always ac-<br/>
quitting himself as an officer mindful of the welfare of his men,<br/>
but never tolerating an infraction of discipline; thoroughly<br/>
versed in the science of his profession, and intrepid to the verge<br/>
of temerity, though never injudiciously so. For his gallantry<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
in the West Indian waters as flag-lieutenant under Rodney in that<br/>
Admiral's crowning victory over De Grasse, he was made a post-<br/>
captain.<br/>
<br/>
Ashore in the garb of a civilian scarce any one would have<br/>
taken him for a sailor, more especially that he never garnished <br/>
unprofessional talk with nautical terms, and grave in his bearing,<br/>
evinced little appreciation of mere humor. It was not out of keep-<br/>
ing with these traits that on a passage when nothing demanded<br/>
his paramount action, he was the most undemonstrative of men.<br/>
Any landsman observing this gentleman not conspicuous by his<br/>
stature and wearing no pronounced insignia, emerging from his<br/>
cabin retreat to the open deck and noting the silent deference of<br/>
the officers retiring to leeward, might have taken him for the<br/>
King's guest, a civilian aboard the King's ship&lt;,&gt; some highly<br/>
honorable discreet envoy on his way to an important post. But<br/>
in fact this unobtrusiveness of demeanor may have proceeded from<br/>
a certain unaffected modesty of manhood sometimes accompa-<br/>
nying a resolute nature, a modesty evinced at all times not call-<br/>
ing for pronounced action, and which shown in any rank of life<br/>
suggests a virtue aristocratic in kind.<br/>
<br/>
As with some others engaged in various departments of the<br/>
world's more heroic activities, Captain Vere though practical<br/>
enough upon occasion would at times betray a certain dreaminess<br/>
of mood. Standing alone on the weather-side of the quarter-deck,<br/>
one hand holding by the rigging he would absently gaze off at<br/>
the blank sea. At the presentation to him then of some minor mat-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ter interrupting the current of his thoughts he would show more<br/>
or less irascibility; but instantly he would control it.<br/>
<br/>
In the navy he was popularly known by the appellation&mdash;Starry<br/>
Vere. How such a designation happened to fall upon one who<br/>
whatever his sturdy qualities was without brilliant ones was in<br/>
this wise: a favorite kinsman, Lord Denton, a free-handed fel-<br/>
low, had been the first to meet and congratulate him upon his<br/>
return to England from the West Indian cruise; and but the day<br/>
previous turning over a copy of Andrew Marvell's poems had<br/>
lighted, not for the first time however, upon the lines entitled<br/>
Appleton House, the name of one of the seats of their common<br/>
ancestor, a hero in the German wars of the seventeenth century,<br/>
in which poem occur the lines,<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;This 'tis to have been from the firstIn a domestic heaven nursed,Under the discipline severeOf Fairfax and the starry Vere.&rdquo; And so, upon embracing his cousin fresh from Rodney's vic-<br/>
tory wherein he had played so gallant a part, brimming over with<br/>
just family pride in the sailor of their house, he ex-<br/>
uberantly exclaimed, &ldquo;Give ye joy, Ed; give ye joy, my starry Vere!&rdquo; This got<br/>
currency, and the novel prefix serving in familiar parlance readily<br/>
to distinguish the Indomitable's Captain from another Vere his<br/>
senior, a distant relative an officer of like rank in the navy, it re-<br/>
mained permanently attached to the surname.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In view of the part that the commander of the Indomitable<br/>
plays in scenes shortly to follow, it may be well to fill out that <br/>
sketch of him outlined in the previous chapter. Aside from his<br/>
qualities as a sea-officer Captain Vere was an exceptional charac-<br/>
ter. Unlike no few of England's renowned sailors, long and ardu-<br/>
ous service with signal devotion to it, had not resulted in absorb-<br/>
ing and salting the entire man. He had a marked leaning towards<br/>
everything intellectual. He loved books, never going to sea with-<br/>
out a newly replenished library, compact but of the best. The<br/>
isolated leisure, in some cases so wearisome, falling at intervals<br/>
to commanders even during a war-cruise, never was tedious to<br/>
Captain Vere. With nothing of that literary taste which less heeds<br/>
the thing conveyed than the vehicle, his bias was towards those<br/>
books to which every serious mind of superior order occupying<br/>
any active post of authority in the world, naturally inclines; <br/>
books treating of actual men and events no matter of what era&mdash;<br/>
history, biography and unconventional writers, who, free from<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
cant and convention, like Montaigne, honestly, and in the spirit<br/>
of common sense philosophize upon realities.<br/>
<br/>
In this love of reading he found confirmation of his own more<br/>
reserved thoughts&mdash;confirmation which he had vainly sought in<br/>
social converse, so that as touching most fundamental topics, there<br/>
had got to be established in him some positive convictions which<br/>
he forefelt would abide in him essentially unmodified so long as<br/>
his intelligent part remained unimpaired. In view of the trou-<br/>
bled period in which his lot was cast this was well for him. His<br/>
settled convictions were as a dyke against those invading waters<br/>
of novel opinion social political and otherwise, which carried<br/>
away as in a torrent no few minds in those days, minds by na-<br/>
ture not inferior to his own. While other members of that aristoc-<br/>
racy to which by birth he belonged were incensed at the innova-<br/>
tors mainly because their theories were inimical to the privileged<br/>
classes, not alone Captain Vere disinterestedly opposed them be-<br/>
cause they seemed to him incapable of embodiment in lasting in-<br/>
stitutions, but at war with the peace of the world and the true<br/>
welfare of mankind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With minds less stored than his and less earnest, some officers<br/>
of his rank, with whom at times he would necessarily consort,<br/>
found him lacking in the companionable quality, a dry and<br/>
bookish gentleman as they deemed. Upon any chance with-<br/>
drawal from their company one would be apt to say to another<br/>
something like this: &ldquo;Vere is a noble fellow, Starry Vere. &lsquo;Spite<br/>
the gazettes, Sir Horatio&rdquo; meaning him with the Lord title &ldquo;is<br/>
at bottom scarce a better seaman or fighter. But between you and<br/>
me now don't you think there is a queer streak of the pedantic<br/>
running through him? Yes, like the King's yarn in a coil of navy-<br/>
rope?&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
Some apparent ground there was for this sort of confidential<br/>
criticism; since not only did the Captain's discourse never fall<br/>
into the jocosely familiar, but in illustrating any point touching<br/>
the stirring personages and events of the time he would be as apt<br/>
to cite some historic character or incident of antiquity &lt;as&gt; he<br/>
would &lt;to&gt; cite from the moderns. He seemed unmindful of<br/>
the circumstance that to his bluff company such remote allusions<br/>
however pertinent they might really be were altogether alien<br/>
to men whose reading was mainly confined to the journals. But<br/>
considerateness in such matters is not easy to natures constituted<br/>
like Captain Vere's. Their honesty prescribes to them directness,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
sometimes far-reaching like that of a migratory fowl that in its<br/>
flight never heeds when it crosses a frontier.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The lieutenants and other commissioned gentlemen forming<br/>
Captain Vere's staff it is not necessary here to particularize nor<br/>
needs it to make any mention of any of the warrant-officers. But<br/>
among the petty officers was one who having much to do with the<br/>
story, may as well be forthwith introduced. This portrait I essay,<br/>
but shall never hit it. This was John Claggart, the master-at-<br/>
arms. But that sea-title may to landsmen seem</span> somewhat <span id="diff-14611" class="diff change" uuid="0f846d5d-3a77-4e84-8b99-b12e211490f0" juxta:range="44158,44317" juxta:connect-to="14610"">equiv-<br/>
ocal. Originally doubtless that petty-officer's function was the in-<br/>
struction of the men in the use of arms, sword or cutlass. But very<br/>
long ago, owing</span> to the <span id="diff-14663" class="diff change" uuid="daed7e44-bdb9-45ef-9afa-d30dbe506c7e" juxta:range="44325,181314" juxta:connect-to="14662"">advance in gunnery making hand-to-hand<br/>
encounters less frequent and giving to nitre and sulphur the pre-<br/>
eminence over steel, that function ceased; the master-at-arms of<br/>
a great warship becoming a sort of Chief of Police charged among<br/>
other matters with the duty of preserving order on the populous<br/>
lower gun-decks.<br/>
<br/>
Claggart was a man of about five-and-thirty, somewhat spare<br/>
and tall, yet of no ill figure upon the whole. His hand was too<br/>
small and shapely to have been accustomed to hard toil. The<br/>
face was a notable one; the features all except the chin cleanly<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
cut as those on a Greek medallion; yet the chin, beardless as<br/>
Tecumseh's, had something of the strange protuberant heaviness <br/>
in its make that recalled the prints of the Rev. Dr. Titus Oates,<br/>
the historic deponent with the clerical drawl in the time of<br/>
Charles II and the fraud of the alleged Popish Plot. It served<br/>
Claggart in his office that his eye could cast a tutoring glance.<br/>
His brow of the sort phrenologically associated with more than<br/>
average intellect; silken jet curls partly clustering over it, mak-<br/>
ing a foil to the pallor below, a pallor tinged with a faint shade of<br/>
amber skin to the hue of time-tinted marbles of old. This com-<br/>
plexion, singularly contrasting with the red or deeply bronzed <br/>
visages of the sailors, and in part the result of his official seclusion<br/>
from the sunlight, though it was not exactly displeasing, never-<br/>
theless seemed to hint of something defective or abnormal in the<br/>
consititution and blood. But his general aspect and manner<br/>
were so suggestive of an education and career incongruous with<br/>
his naval function that when not actively engaged in it he looked<br/>
like a man of high quality, social and moral, who for reasons of<br/>
his own was keeping incog. Nothing was known of his former<br/>
life. It might be that he was an Englishman; and yet there<br/>
lurked a bit of accent in his speech suggesting that possibly he<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
was not such by birth, but through naturalization in early child-<br/>
hood. Among certain grizzled sea-gossips of the gun-decks and <br/>
forecastle went a rumor perdue that the master-at-arms was a<br/>
chevalier who had volunteered into the King's navy by way of<br/>
compounding for some mysterious swindle whereof he had been<br/>
arraigned at the King's Bench. The fact that nobody could sub-<br/>
stantiate this report was, of course, nothing against its secret<br/>
currency. Such a rumor once started on the gun-decks in refer-<br/>
ence to almost anyone below the rank of a commissioned officer<br/>
would, during the period assigned to this narrative, have seemed<br/>
not altogether wanting in credibility to the tarry old wiseacres<br/>
of a man-of-war crew. And indeed a man of Claggart's accomplish-<br/>
ments, without prior nautical experience entering the navy at<br/>
mature life, as he did, and necessarily allotted at the start to the<br/>
lowest grade in it; a man too who never made allusion to his<br/>
previous life ashore; these were circumstances which in the<br/>
dearth of exact knowledge as to his true antecedents opened to<br/>
the invidious a vague field for unfavorable surmise.<br/>
<br/>
But the sailors' dog-watch gossip concerning him derived a<br/>
vague plausibility from the fact that now for some period the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
British Navy could so little afford to be squeamish in the matter<br/>
of keeping up the muster-rolls, that not only were press-gangs<br/>
notoriously abroad both afloat and ashore, but there was little<br/>
or no secret about another matter, namely that the London<br/>
police were at liberty to capture any able-bodied suspect, any<br/>
questionable fellow at large and summarily ship him to the dock-<br/>
yard or fleet. Furthermore, even among voluntary enlistments<br/>
there were instances where the motive thereto partook neither of<br/>
patriotic impulse nor yet of a random desire to experience a bit<br/>
of sea-life and martial adventure. Insolvent debtors of minor<br/>
grade, together with the promiscuous lame ducks of morality<br/>
found in the navy a convenient and secure refuge. Secure, be-<br/>
cause once enlisted aboard a King's-Ship, they were as much in<br/>
sanctuary, as the transgressor of the middle ages harboring him-<br/>
self under the shadow of the altar. Such sanctioned irregulari-<br/>
ties which for obvious reasons the Government would hardly<br/>
think to parade at the time and which consequently, and as af-<br/>
fecting the least influential class of mankind, have all but dropped<br/>
into oblivion lend color to something for the truth whereof I<br/>
do not vouch, and hence have some scruple in stating; something<br/>
I remember having seen in print, though the book I cannot recall;<br/>
but the same thing was personally communicated to me now more<br/>
than forty years ago by an old pensioner in a cocked hat with<br/>
whom I had a most interesting talk on the terrace at Greenwich,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
a Baltimore negro, a Trafalgar man. It was to this effect: In the<br/>
case of a warship short of hands whose speedy sailing was im-<br/>
perative, the deficient quota in lack of any other way of making<br/>
it good, would be eked out by drafts called direct from the jails.<br/>
For reasons previously suggested it would not perhaps be very<br/>
easy at the present day directly to prove or disprove the allega-<br/>
tion. But allowed as a verity, how significant would it be of Eng-<br/>
land's straits at the time confronted by those wars which like<br/>
a flight of harpies rose shrieking from the din and dust of the<br/>
fallen Bastille. That era appears measurably clear to us who look<br/>
back at it, and but read of it. But to the grandfathers of us grey-<br/>
beards, the more thoughtful of them, the genius of it presented<br/>
an aspect like that of Camo&euml;ns' Spirit of the Cape, an eclipsing<br/>
menace mysterious and prodigious. Not America was exempt<br/>
from apprehension. At the height of Napoleon's unexampled con-<br/>
quests, there were Americans who had fought at Bunker Hill<br/>
who looked forward to the possibility that the Atlantic might<br/>
prove no barrier against the ultimate schemes of this French por-<br/>
tentous upstart from the revolutionary chaos who seemed in act<br/>
of fulfilling judgment prefigured in the Apocalypse.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But the less credence was to be given to the gun-deck talk<br/>
touching Claggart, seeing that no man holding his office in a man-<br/>
of-war can ever hope to be popular with the crew. Besides, in<br/>
derogatory comments upon anyone against whom they have a<br/>
grudge, or for any reason or no reason mislike, sailors are much <br/>
like landsmen, they are apt to exaggerate or romance it.<br/>
<br/>
About as much was really known to the Indomitable's tars of<br/>
the master-at-arms' career before entering the service as an as-<br/>
tronomer knows about a comet's travels prior to its first ob-<br/>
servable appearance in the sky. The verdict of the sea quid-<br/>
nunc's has been cited only by way of showing what sort of moral<br/>
impression the man made upon rude uncultivated natures whose<br/>
conceptions of human wickedness were necessarily of the nar-<br/>
rowest, limited to ideas of vulgar rascality,&mdash;a thief among the<br/>
swinging hammocks during a night-watch, or the man-brokers and<br/>
land-sharks of the sea-ports.<br/>
<br/>
It was no gossip, however, but fact, that though, as before<br/>
hinted, Claggart upon his entrance into the navy was, as a novice,<br/>
assigned to the least honorable section of a man-of-war's crew,<br/>
embracing the drudgery, he did not long remain there.<br/>
<br/>
The superior capacity he immediately evinced, his constitu-<br/>
tional sobriety, ingratiating deference to superiors, together with<br/>
a peculiar ferreting genius manifested on a singular occasion, all<br/>
this capped by a certain austere patriotism abruptly advanced<br/>
him to the position of master-at-arms.<br/>
<br/>
Of this maritime Chief of Police the ship's corporals, so called,<br/>
were the immediate subordinates, and compliant ones; and this,<br/>
as is to be noted in some business departments ashore, almost to<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
a degree inconsistent with entire moral volition. His place put<br/>
various converging wires of underground influence under the<br/>
Chief's control, capable when astutely worked through his under-<br/>
strappers of operating to the mysterious discomfort if nothing<br/>
worse, of any of the sea-commonalty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Life in the foretop well agreed with Billy Budd. There, when not<br/>
actually engaged on the yards yet higher aloft, the topmen, who<br/>
as such had been picked out for youth and activity, constituted<br/>
an aerial club lounging at ease against the smaller stunsails rolled<br/>
up into cushions, spinning yarns like the lazy gods, and frequently<br/>
amused with what was going on in the busy world of the decks<br/>
below. No wonder then that a young fellow of Billy's disposition<br/>
was well content in such society. Giving no cause of offense to<br/>
anybody, he was always alert at a call. So in the merchant serv-<br/>
ice it had been with him. But now such punctiliousness in duty<br/>
was shown that his topmates would sometimes good-naturedly<br/>
laugh at him for it. This heightened alacrity had its cause, namely,<br/>
the impression made upon him by the first formal gangway-<br/>
punishment he had ever witnessed, which befell the day following<br/>
his impressment. It had been incurred by a little fellow, young,<br/>
a novice an after-guardsman absent from his assigned post when<br/>
the ship was being put about; a dereliction resulting in a rather<br/>
serious hitch to that maneuver, one demanding instantaneous<br/>
promptitude in letting go and making fast. When Billy saw the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
culprit's naked back under the scourge gridironed with red welts,<br/>
and worse; when he marked the dire expression in the liberated<br/>
man's face as with his woolen shirt flung over him by the execu-<br/>
tioner he rushed forward from the spot to bury himself in the<br/>
crowd, Billy was horrified. He resolved that never through re-<br/>
missness would he make himself liable to such a visitation or do<br/>
or omit aught that might merit even verbal reproof. What then<br/>
was his surprise and concern when ultimately he found himself<br/>
getting into petty trouble occasionally about such matters as<br/>
the stowage of his bag or something amiss in his hammock, mat-<br/>
ters under the police oversight of the ship's corporals of the lower<br/>
decks, and which brought down on him a vague threat from one<br/>
of them.<br/>
<br/>
So heedful in all things as he was, how could this be? He<br/>
could not understand it, and it more than vexed him. When he<br/>
spoke to his young topmates about it they were either lightly<br/>
incredulous, or found something comical in his unconcealed <br/>
anxiety. &ldquo;Is it your bag, Billy?&rdquo; said one &ldquo;well, sew yourself up<br/>
in it, bully boy, and then you'll be sure to know if anybody med-<br/>
dles with it.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
Now there was a veteran aboard who because his years began<br/>
to disqualify him for more active work had been recently as-<br/>
signed duty as mainmast-man in his watch, looking to the gear<br/>
belayed at the rail round about that great spar near the deck. At<br/>
off-times the foretopman had picked up some acquaintance with<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
him, and now in his trouble it occurred to him that he might be<br/>
the sort of person to go to for wise counsel. He was an old Dan-<br/>
sker long anglicized in the service, of few words, many wrinkles<br/>
and some honorable scars. His wizened face, time-tinted and<br/>
weather-stained to the complexion of an antique parchment, <br/>
was here and there peppered blue by the chance explosion of<br/>
a gun-cartridge in action. He was an Agamemnon-man; some<br/>
two years prior to the time of this story having served under<br/>
Nelson, when but Sir Horatio, in that ship immortal in naval<br/>
memory, and which dismantled and in part broken up to her<br/>
bare ribs is seen a grand skeleton in Haydon's etching. As one<br/>
of a boarding-party from the Agamemnon he had received a cut<br/>
slantwise along one temple and cheek, leaving a long pale scar<br/>
like a streak of dawn's light falling athwart the dark visage. It<br/>
was on account of that scar and the affair in which it was known<br/>
that he had received it, as well as from his blue-peppered com-<br/>
plexion that the Dansker went among the Indomitable's crew<br/>
by the name of &ldquo;Board-her-in-the-smoke.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
Now the first time that his small weazel-eyes happened to light<br/>
on Billy Budd, a certain grim internal merriment set all his an-<br/>
cient wrinkles into antic play. Was it that his eccentric unsenti-<br/>
mental old sapience primitive in its kind saw or thought it saw<br/>
something which in contrast with the warship's environment<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
looked oddly incongruous in the handsome sailor? But after slyly<br/>
studying him at intervals, the old Merlin's equivocal merriment<br/>
was modified; for now when the twain would meet, it would<br/>
start in his face a quizzing sort of look, but it would be but mo-<br/>
mentary and sometimes replaced by an expression of speculative<br/>
query as to what might eventually befall a nature like that,<br/>
dropped into a world not without some man-traps and against<br/>
whose subtleties simple courage lacking experience and address<br/>
and without any touch of defensive ugliness, is of little avail; and<br/>
where such innocence as man is capable of does yet in a moral<br/>
emergency not always sharpen the faculties or enlighten the<br/>
will.<br/>
<br/>
However it was the Dansker in his ascetic way rather took<br/>
to Billy. Nor was this only because of a certain philosophic inter-<br/>
est in such a character. There was another cause. While the old<br/>
man's eccentricities, sometimes bordering on the ursine, repelled<br/>
the juniors, Billy, undeterred thereby, revering him as a salt hero <br/>
would make advances, never passing the old Agamemnon-man<br/>
without a salutation marked by that respect which is seldom lost<br/>
on the aged however crabbed at times or whatever their station<br/>
in life. There was a vein of dry humor, or what not, in the mast-<br/>
man; and, whether in freak of patriarchal irony touching Billy's<br/>
youth and athletic frame, or for some other and more recondite<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
reason, from the first in addressing him he always substituted<br/>
Baby for Billy. The Dansker in fact being the originator of the<br/>
name by which the foretopman eventually became known aboard<br/>
ship.<br/>
<br/>
Well then, in his mysterious little difficulty going in quest of<br/>
the wrinkled one, Billy found him off duty in a dog-watch<br/>
ruminating by himself seated on a shot-box of the upper gun-deck<br/>
now and then surveying with a somewhat cynical regard certain<br/>
of the more swaggering promenaders there. Billy recounted his<br/>
trouble, again wondering how it all happened. The salt seer at-<br/>
tentively listened, accompanying the foretopman's recital with<br/>
queer twitching of his wrinkles and problematical little sparkles<br/>
of his small ferret eyes. Making an end of his story, the fore-<br/>
topman asked, &ldquo;And now, Dansker, do tell me what you think<br/>
of it.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
The old man, shoving up the front of his tarpaulin and de-<br/>
liberately rubbing the long slant scar at the point where it en-<br/>
tered the thin hair, laconically said, &ldquo;Baby Budd, Jemmy Legs&rdquo;<br/>
(meaning the master-at-arms) &ldquo;is down on you&lt;.&gt;&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo; Jemmy Legs!&rdquo; ejaculated Billy his welkin eyes expanding;<br/>
&ldquo;what for? Why he calls me the sweet and pleasant young fellow,<br/>
they tell me.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Does he so?&rdquo; grinned the grizzled one; then said &ldquo;Ay Baby<br/>
Lad a sweet voice has Jemmy Legs.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;No, not always. But to me he has. I seldom pass him but<br/>
there comes a pleasant word.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;And that's because he's down upon you, Baby Budd.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
Such reiteration along with the manner of it, incomprehensible<br/>
to a novice, disturbed Billy almost as much as the mystery for<br/>
which he had sought explanation. Something less unpleasingly<br/>
oracular he tried to extract; but the old sea-Chiron thinking per-<br/>
haps that for the nonce he had sufficiently instructed his young<br/>
Achilles, pursed his lips, gathered his wrinkles together and would<br/>
commit himself to nothing further.<br/>
<br/>
Years, and those experiences which befall certain shrewder <br/>
men subordinated life-long to the will of superiors, all this had<br/>
developed in the Dansker the pithy guarded cynicism that was<br/>
his leading characteristic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The next day an incident served to confirm Billy Budd in his<br/>
incredulity as to the Dansker's strange summing up of the case<br/>
submitted.<br/>
<br/>
The ship at noon going large before the wind was rolling on<br/>
her course, and he below at dinner and engaged in some sport-<br/>
ful talk with the members of his mess, chanced in a sudden lurch<br/>
to spill the entire contents of his soup-pan upon the new <br/>
scrubbed deck. Claggart, the master-at-arms, official rattan in<br/>
hand, happened to be passing along the battery in a bay of which<br/>
the mess was lodged, and the greasy liquid streamed just across<br/>
his path. Stepping over it, he was proceeding on his way without<br/>
comment, since the matter was nothing to take notice of under<br/>
the circumstances, when he happened to observe who it was that<br/>
had done the spilling. His countenance changed. Pausing, he was<br/>
about to ejaculate something hasty at the sailor, but checked<br/>
himself, and pointing down to the streaming soup, playfully<br/>
tapped him from behind with his rattan, saying in a low musical<br/>
voice peculiar to him at times &ldquo;Handsomely done, my lad! And<br/>
handsome is as handsome did it too!&rdquo; and with that passed on.<br/>
Not noted by Billy as not coming within his view was the in-<br/>
voluntary smile, or rather grimace, that accompanied Claggart's<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
equivocal words. Aridly it drew down the thin corners of his<br/>
shapely mouth. But everybody taking his remark as meant for<br/>
humorous, and at which therefore as coming from a superior<br/>
they were bound to laugh, &ldquo;with counterfeited glee&rdquo; acted ac-<br/>
cordingly; and Billy tickled, it may be, by the allusion to his<br/>
being the handsome sailor, merrily joined in; then addressing his<br/>
messmates exclaimed &ldquo;There now, who says that Jemmy Legs<br/>
is down on me!&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;And who said he was, Beauty?&rdquo; demanded one Donald with<br/>
some surprise. Whereat the foretopman looked a little foolish re-<br/>
calling that it was only one person, Board-her-in-the-smoke who<br/>
had suggested what to him was the smoky idea that this master-<br/>
at-arms was in any peculiar way hostile to him. Meantime that <br/>
functionary resuming his path must have momentarily worn some<br/>
expression less guarded than that of the bitter smile and, usurp-<br/>
ing the face from the heart, some distorting expression perhaps <br/>
for a drummer-boy, heedlessly frolicking along from the opposite<br/>
direction, and chancing to come into light collision with his per-<br/>
son was strangely disconcerted by his aspect. Nor was the impres-<br/>
sion lessened when the official, impulsively giving him a sharp<br/>
cut with the rattan, vehemently exclaimed &ldquo;Look where you go!&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What was the matter with the master-at-arms? And, be the<br/>
matter what it might, how could it have direct relation to Billy<br/>
Budd with whom prior to the affair of the spilled soup he had<br/>
never come into any special contact official or otherwise? What<br/>
indeed could the trouble have to do with one so little inclined<br/>
to give offense as the merchant ship's peacemaker, even him<br/>
who in Claggart's own phrase was &ldquo;the sweet and pleasant young<br/>
fellow? &lt;&rdquo;&gt; Yes, why should Jemmy Legs, to borrow the Dan-<br/>
sker's expression, be down on the Handsome Sailor?<br/>
<br/>
But at heart and not for nothing, as the late chance encounter<br/>
may indicate to the discerning, down on him, secretly down on<br/>
him, he assuredly was.<br/>
<br/>
Now to invent something touching the more private career of<br/>
Claggart, something involving Billy Budd, of which something<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the latter should be wholly ignorant, some romantic incident<br/>
implying that Claggart's knowledge of the young blue-jacket began at some pe-<br/>
riod anterior to catching sight of him on board<br/>
the seventy-four&mdash;all this, not so difficult to do, might avail in<br/>
a way more or less interesting to account for whatever enigma<br/>
may appear to lurk in the case. But in fact there was nothing of<br/>
the sort. And yet the cause, necessarily to be assumed as the<br/>
sole one assignable, is in its very realism as much charged with<br/>
that prime element of Radcliffian romance, the mysterious, <br/>
as any that the ingenuity of the author of the Mysteries of Udol-<br/>
pho could devise. For what can more partake of the mysterious<br/>
than an antipathy spontaneous and profound such as is evoked in<br/>
certain exceptional mortals by the mere aspect of some other<br/>
mortal, however harmless he may be? if not called forth by this<br/>
very harmlessness itself.<br/>
<br/>
Now there can exist no irritating juxtaposition of dissimilar<br/>
personalities comparable to that which is possible aboard a great<br/>
warship fully manned and at sea. There, every day among all<br/>
ranks almost every man comes into more or less of contact with<br/>
almost every other man. Wholly there to avoid even the sight<br/>
of an aggravating object one must needs give it Jonah's toss or<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
jump overboard himself. Imagine how all this might eventually<br/>
operate on some peculiar human creature the direct reverse of<br/>
a saint?<br/>
<br/>
But for the adequate comprehending of Claggart by a normal<br/>
nature these hints are insufficient. To pass from a normal na-<br/>
ture to him one must cross &ldquo;the deadly space between.&rdquo; And this<br/>
is best done by indirection.<br/>
<br/>
Long ago an honest scholar my senior, said to me in reference<br/>
to one who like himself is now no more, a man so unimpeach-<br/>
ably respectable that against him nothing was ever openly said<br/>
though among the few something was whispered, &ldquo;Yes, X&mdash;&mdash;<br/>
is a nut not to be cracked by the tap of a lady's fan. You are<br/>
aware that I am the adherent of no organized religion much less<br/>
of any philosophy built into a system. Well, for all that, I think<br/>
that to try and get into X&mdash;&mdash;, enter his labyrinth and get out<br/>
again, without a clue derived from some source other than what<br/>
is known as knowledge of the world&mdash;that were hardly possible,<br/>
at least for me.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;X&mdash;&mdash;however singular a study to some, is yet<br/>
human, and knowledge of the world assuredly implies the knowl-<br/>
edge of human nature, and in most of its varieties.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Yes, but a superficial knowledge of it, serving ordinary pur-<br/>
poses. But for anything deeper, I am not certain whether to know<br/>
the world and to know human nature be not two distinct branches<br/>
of knowledge, which while they may coexist in the same heart,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
yet either may exist with little or nothing of the other. Nay, in<br/>
an average man of the world, his constant rubbing with it blunts<br/>
that fine spiritual insight indispensable to the understanding of<br/>
the essential in certain exceptional characters, whether evil ones<br/>
or good. In a matter of some importance I have seen a girl wind<br/>
an old lawyer about her little finger. Nor was it the dotage of<br/>
senile love. Nothing of the sort. But he knew law better than he<br/>
knew the girl's heart. Coke and Blackstone hardly shed so much<br/>
light into obscure spiritual places as the Hebrew prophets. And<br/>
who were they? Mostly recluses.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
At the time my inexperience was such that I did not quite see<br/>
the drift of all this. It may be that I see it now. And, indeed,<br/>
if that lexicon which is based on Holy Writ were any longer popu-<br/>
lar, one might with less difficulty define and denominate certain<br/>
phenomenal men. As it is, one must turn to some authority not<br/>
liable to the charge of being tinctured with Biblical element.<br/>
<br/>
In a list of definitions included in the authentic translation of<br/>
Plato, a list attributed to him, occurs this: &ldquo;Natural Depravity:<br/>
a depravity according to nature.&rdquo; A definition which though<br/>
savoring of Calvinism, by no means involves Calvin's dogma as to<br/>
total mankind. Evidently its intent makes it applicable but to<br/>
individuals. Not many are the examples of this depravity which<br/>
the gallows and jail supply. At any rate for notable instances,<br/>
since these have no vulgar alloy of the brute in them, but in-<br/>
variably are dominated by intellectuality, one must go elsewhere.<br/>
Civilization, especially if of the austerer sort, is auspicious to it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It folds itself in the mantle of respectability. It has its certain<br/>
negative virtues serving as silent auxiliaries. It never allows wine<br/>
to get within its guard. It is not going too far to say that it is<br/>
without vices or small sins. There is a phenomenal pride in it<br/>
that excludes them from anything mercenary or avaricious. In<br/>
short the depravity here meant partakes nothing of the sordid or<br/>
sensual. It is serious, but free from acerbity. Though no flatterer<br/>
of mankind it never speaks ill of it.<br/>
<br/>
But the thing which in eminent instances signalizes so excep-<br/>
tional a nature is this: though the man's even temper and dis-<br/>
creet bearing would seem to intimate a mind peculiarly subject<br/>
to the law of reason, not the less in his heart he would seem<br/>
to riot in complete exemption from that law having apparently<br/>
little to do with reason further than to employ it as an ambidexter<br/>
implement for effecting the irrational. That is to say: toward the<br/>
accomplishment of an aim which in wantonness of malignity<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
would seem to partake of the insane, he will direct a cool judg-<br/>
ment sagacious and sound.<br/>
<br/>
These men are true madmen, and of the most dangerous sort,<br/>
for their lunacy is not continuous but occasional evoked by<br/>
some special object; it is probably secretive which is as much to<br/>
say it is self-contained, so that when moreover, most active it is<br/>
to the average mind not distinguishable from sanity, and for the<br/>
reason above suggested that whatever its aims may be, and the<br/>
aim is never declared the method and the outward proceeding<br/>
is always perfectly rational.<br/>
<br/>
Now something such was Claggart, in whom was the mania<br/>
of an evil nature, not engendered by vicious training or corrupt-<br/>
ing books or licentious living, but born with him and innate, in<br/>
short &ldquo;a depravity according to nature.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, can it be the phenomenon, disowned or at least<br/>
concealed, that in some criminal cases puzzles the courts? For<br/>
this cause have our juries at times not only to endure the pro-<br/>
longed contentions of lawyers with their fees, but also the yet<br/>
more perplexing strife of the medical experts with theirs? But<br/>
why leave it to them? Why not subpoena (?) as well the cleri-<br/>
cal proficients? Their vocation bringing them into peculiar con-<br/>
tact with so many human beings, and sometimes in their least<br/>
guarded hour, in interviews very much more confidential than<br/>
those of physician and patient; this would seem to qualify them<br/>
to know something about those intricacies involved in the ques-<br/>
tion of moral responsibility; whether in a given case, say, the <br/>
crime proceeded from mania in the brain or rabies of the heart.<br/>
As to any differences among themselves these clerical proficients<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
might develop on the stand, these could hardly be greater than<br/>
the direct contradictions exchanged between the remunerated <br/>
medical experts.<br/>
<br/>
Dark sayings are these, some will say. But why? Is it because<br/>
they somewhat savor of Holy Writ in its phrase &ldquo;mysteries of<br/>
iniquity&rdquo;? If they do, such savor was foreign from my intention <br/>
for little will it commend these pages to many a reader of today.<br/>
<br/>
The point of the present story turning on the hidden nature<br/>
of the master-at-arms has necessitated this chapter. , With an<br/>
added hint or two in connection with the incident at the mess, <br/>
the resumed narrative must be left to vindicate as it may, its<br/>
own credibility.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pale ire, envy and despair<br/>
<br/>
That Claggart's figure was not amiss, and his face, save the chin,<br/>
well moulded, has already been said. Of these favorable points<br/>
he seemed not insensible, for he was not only neat but careful in<br/>
his dress. But the form of Billy Budd was heroic; and if his face<br/>
was without the intellectual look of the pallid Claggart's, not the<br/>
less was it lit, like his, from within, though from a different<br/>
source. The bonfire in his heart made luminous the rose-tan in his<br/>
cheek.<br/>
<br/>
In view of the marked contrast between the persons of the<br/>
twain, it is more than probable that when the master-at-arms in<br/>
the scene last given applied to the sailor the proverb Handsome<br/>
is as handsome does; he there let escape an ironic inkling, not<br/>
caught by the young sailors who heard it, as to what it was that<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
had first moved him against Billy, namely, his significant per-<br/>
sonal beauty.<br/>
<br/>
Now envy and antipathy passions irreconcilable in reason,<br/>
nevertheless in fact may spring conjoined like Chang and Eng<br/>
in one birth. Is Envy then such a monster? Well, though many<br/>
an arraigned mortal has in hopes of mitigated penalty pleaded<br/>
guilty to horrible actions, did ever anybody seriously confess to<br/>
envy? Something there is in it universally felt to be more shame-<br/>
ful than even felonious crime. And not only does everybody dis-<br/>
own it but the better sort are inclined to incredulity when it is<br/>
in earnest imputed to an intelligent man. But since its lodgment<br/>
is in the heart not the brain, no degree of intellect supplies a<br/>
guarantee against it. But Claggart's was no vulgar form of the<br/>
passion. Nor, as directed toward Billy Budd, did it partake of<br/>
that streak of apprehensive jealousy which marred Saul's visage<br/>
perturbedly brooding on the comely young David. Claggart's<br/>
envy struck deeper. If askance he eyed the good looks, cheery<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
health and frank enjoyment of young life in Billy Budd, it was<br/>
because these went along with a nature that as Claggart mag-<br/>
netically felt, had in its simplicity never willed malice or experi-<br/>
enced the reactionary bite of that serpent. To him, the spirit<br/>
lodged within Billy, and looking out from his welkin eyes as<br/>
from windows, that ineffability it was which made the dimple<br/>
in his dyed cheek, suppled his joints, and dancing in his yellow<br/>
curls made him pre&euml;minently the Handsome Sailor. One person<br/>
excepted the master-at-arms was perhaps the only man in the<br/>
ship intellectually capable of adequately appreciating the<br/>
moral phenomenon presented in Billy Budd. And the insight but<br/>
intensified his passion, which assuming various secret forms<br/>
within him, at times assumed that of cynic disdain&mdash;disdain of<br/>
innocence&mdash;to be nothing more than innocent! Yet in an aesthetic<br/>
way he saw the charm of it, the courageous free-and-easy tem-<br/>
per of it, and fain would have shared it, but he despaired of it.<br/>
<br/>
With no power to annul the elemental evil in him, though<br/>
readily enough he could hide it; apprehending the good, but<br/>
powerless to be it; a nature like Claggart's surcharged with energy<br/>
as such natures almost invariably are, what recourse is left to it<br/>
but to recoil upon itself and like the scorpion for which the<br/>
Creator alone is responsible, act out to the end the part al-<br/>
lotted it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Passion, and passion in its profoundest, is not a thing demanding<br/>
a palatial stage whereon to play its part. Down among the<br/>
groundlings, among the beggars and rakers of the garbage, pro-<br/>
found passion is enacted. And the circumstances that provoke it,<br/>
however trivial or mean, are no measure of its power. In the pres-<br/>
ent instance the stage is a scrubbed gun-deck, and one of the<br/>
external provocations a man-of-war's man's spilled soup.<br/>
<br/>
Now when the master-at-arms noticed whence came that greasy<br/>
fluid streaming before his feet, he must have taken it&mdash;to some<br/>
extent willfully, perhaps not for the mere accident it assuredly <br/>
was, but for the sly escape of a spontaneous feeling on Billy's<br/>
part more or less answering to the antipathy on his own. In effect<br/>
a foolish demonstration he must have thought, and very harmless,<br/>
like the futile kick of a heifer, which yet were the heifer a<br/>
shod stallion would not be so harmless. Even so was it that into<br/>
the gall of Claggart's envy he infused the vitriol of his contempt.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But the incident confirmed to him certain tell-tale reports pur-<br/>
veyed to his ear by Squeak, one of his more cunning corporals,<br/>
a grizzled little man, so nicknamed by the sailors on account of<br/>
his squeaky voice, and sharp visage ferreting about the dark<br/>
corners of the lower decks after interlopers, satirically suggesting<br/>
to them the idea of a rat in a cellar.<br/>
<br/>
From his chief's employing him as an implicit tool in laying<br/>
little traps for the worriment of the foretopman&mdash;for it was from<br/>
the master-at-arms that the petty persecutions heretofore adverted<br/>
to had proceeded&mdash; the corporal having naturally enough con-<br/>
cluded that his master could have no love for the sailor, made it<br/>
his business, faithful understrapper that he was, to foment the<br/>
ill blood by perverting to his chief certain innocent frolics of the<br/>
good-natured foretopman, besides inventing for his mouth <br/>
sundry contumelious epithets he claimed to have overheard him<br/>
let fall. The master-at-arms never suspected the veracity of<br/>
these reports, more especially as to the epithets, for he well knew<br/>
how secretly unpopular may become a master-at-arms at least a<br/>
master-at-arms of those days zealous in his function, and how<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the blue-jackets shoot at him in private their raillery and wit; the<br/>
nickname by which he goes among them ( Jemmy Legs) imply-<br/>
ing under the form of merriment their cherished disrespect and<br/>
dislike.<br/>
<br/>
But in view of the greediness of hate for patrolmen it hardly<br/>
needed a purveyor to feed Claggart's passion. An uncommon pru-<br/>
dence is habitual with the subtler depravity, for it has every-<br/>
thing to hide. And in case of an injury but suspected its secretive-<br/>
ness voluntarily cuts it off from enlightenment or disillusion; and,<br/>
not unreluctantly, action is taken upon surmise as upon cer-<br/>
tainty. And the retaliation is apt to be in monstrous disproportion<br/>
to the supposed offense; for when in anybody was revenge in<br/>
its exactions aught else but an inordinate usurer? But how with<br/>
Claggart's conscience? For though consciences are unalike as<br/>
foreheads, every intelligence, not excluding the Scriptural devils<br/>
who &ldquo;believe and tremble,&rdquo; has one. But Claggart's conscience<br/>
being but the lawyer to his will, made ogres of trifles, probably<br/>
arguing that the motive imputed to Billy in spilling the soup<br/>
just when he did, together with the epithets alleged, these, if<br/>
nothing more, made a strong case against him; nay, justified<br/>
animosity into a sort of retributive righteousness. The Pharisee is<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the Guy Fawkes prowling in the hid chambers underlying the <br/>
Claggart's. And they can really form no conception of an unre-<br/>
ciprocated malice. Probably, the master-at-arms' clandestine per-<br/>
secution of Billy was started to try the temper of the man; but<br/>
it had not developed any quality in him that enmity could make<br/>
official use of or even pervert into even plausible self-justifica-<br/>
tion; so that the occurrence at the mess, petty if it were, was a<br/>
welcome one to that peculiar conscience assigned to be the private<br/>
mentor of Claggart; and for the rest, not improbably it put him<br/>
upon new experiments.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not many days after the last incident narrated something befell<br/>
Billy Budd that more gravelled him than aught that had pre-<br/>
viously occurred.<br/>
<br/>
It was a warm night for the latitude; and the foretopman,<br/>
whose watch at the time was properly below, was dozing on the<br/>
uppermost deck whither he had ascended from his hot ham-<br/>
mock one of hundreds suspended so closely wedged together over<br/>
a lower gun-deck that there was little or no swing to them. He<br/>
lay as in the shadow of a hill-side stretched under the lee of the<br/>
booms, a piled ridge of spare spars amidships between foremast<br/>
and mainmast and among which the ship's largest boat, the<br/>
launch, was stowed. Alongside of three other slumberers from be-<br/>
low, he lay near that end of the booms which approached from<br/>
the foremast; his station aloft on duty as a foretopman being just <br/>
over the deck station of the forecastlemen entitling him according<br/>
to usage to make himself more or less at home in that neighbor-<br/>
hood.<br/>
<br/>
Presently he was stirred into semi-consciousness by somebody,<br/>
who must have previously sounded the sleep of the others, touch-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ing his shoulder, and then as the foretopman raised his head,<br/>
breathing into his ear in a quick whisper, &ldquo;Slip into the lee fore-<br/>
chains, Billy; there is something in the wind. Don't speak. Quick.<br/>
I will meet you there;&rdquo; and disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
Now Billy like sundry other essentially good-natured ones had<br/>
some of the weaknesses inseparable from essential good-na-<br/>
ture; and among these was a reluctance, almost an incapacity of<br/>
plumply saying no to an abrupt proposition not obviously absurd,<br/>
on the face of it, nor obviously unfriendly, nor iniquitous. And be-<br/>
ing of warm blood he had not the phlegm tacitly to negative any<br/>
proposition by an unresponsive inaction. Like his sense of fear, his<br/>
apprehension as to aught outside of the honest and natural was<br/>
seldom very quick. Besides, upon the present occasion, the drowse<br/>
from his sleep still hung upon him.<br/>
<br/>
However it was, he mechanically rose and, sleepily wonder-<br/>
ing what could be in the wind, betook himself to the designated<br/>
place, a narrow platform, one of six, outside of the high bul-<br/>
warks and screened by the great dead-eyes and multiple columned<br/>
lanyards of the shrouds and back-stays; and, in a great warship<br/>
of that time, of dimensions commensurate to the hull's magni-<br/>
tude; a tarry balcony in short overhanging the sea, and so se-<br/>
cluded that one mariner of the Indomitable, a nonconformist old<br/>
tar of serious turn, made it even in daytime his private oratory.<br/>
<br/>
In this retired nook the stranger soon joined Billy Budd. There<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
was no moon yet; a haze obscured the starlight. He could not dis-<br/>
tinctly see the stranger's face. Yet from something in the outline<br/>
and carriage, Billy took him to be, and correctly, one of the after-<br/>
guard.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Hist! Billy,&rdquo; said the man; in the same quick cautionary whis-<br/>
per as before &lt;,&gt; &ldquo;You were impressed, weren't you? Well, so<br/>
was I;&rdquo; and he paused as to mark the effect. But Billy not knowing<br/>
exactly what to make of this said nothing. Then the other: &ldquo;We<br/>
are not the only impressed ones, Billy. There's a gang of us.&mdash;<br/>
Couldn't you&mdash;help&mdash;at a pinch?&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&lt;&rdquo;&gt; demanded Billy here shaking off his<br/>
drowse.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Hist, hist!&rdquo; the hurried whisper now growing husky, &ldquo;see<br/>
here;&rdquo; and the man held up two small objects faintly twinkling in<br/>
the night light; &ldquo;see, they are yours, Billy if you'll only&mdash;&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
But Billy here broke in, and in his resentful eagerness<br/>
to deliver himself his vocal infirmity somewhat intruded;<br/>
&ldquo;D-D-Damme, I don't know what you are d-driving at, or what<br/>
you mean, but you had better g-g-go where you belong!&rdquo; For the<br/>
moment the fellow, as confounded, did not stir; and Billy, spring-<br/>
ing to his feet, said &ldquo;If you d-don't start I'll t-t-toss you back over<br/>
the r-rail!&rdquo; There was no mistaking this and the mysterious emis-<br/>
sary decamped, disappearing in the direction of the mainmast<br/>
in the shadow of the booms.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Hello, what's the matter?&rdquo; here came growling from a fore-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
castleman awakened from his deck-doze by Billy's raised voice.<br/>
And as the foretopman reappeared and was recognized by him;<br/>
&ldquo;Ah, Beauty, is it you? Well, something must have been the matter<br/>
for you st-st-stuttered.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; rejoined Billy, now mastering the impediment; &ldquo;I found<br/>
an afterguardsman in our part of the ship here and I bid him be<br/>
off where he belongs.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;And is that all you did about it, foretopman?&rdquo; gruffly de-<br/>
manded another, an irascible old fellow of brick-colored visage<br/>
and hair, and who was known to his associate forecastlemen as<br/>
Red Pepper; &ldquo;Such sneaks I should like to marry to the gunner's<br/>
daughter!&rdquo; by that expression meaning that he would like to sub-<br/>
ject them to disciplinary castigation over a gun.<br/>
<br/>
However, Billy's rendering of the matter satisfactorily ac-<br/>
counted to these inquirers, for the brief commotion since of all<br/>
the sections of a ship's company the forecastlemen, veterans for<br/>
the most part and bigoted in their sea-prejudices, are the most<br/>
jealous in resenting territorial encroachments, especially on the<br/>
part of any of the afterguard, of whom they have but a sorry opin-<br/>
ion, chiefly landsmen, never going aloft except to reef or furl the<br/>
mainsail, and in no wise competent to handle a marline-spike or<br/>
turn in a dead-eye, say.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This incident sorely puzzled Billy Budd. It was an entirely new<br/>
experience; the first time in his life that he had ever been per-<br/>
sonally approached in underhand intriguing fashion. Prior to this<br/>
encounter he had known nothing of the afterguardsman, the two<br/>
men being stationed wide apart, one forward and aloft during his<br/>
watch, the other on deck and aft.<br/>
<br/>
What could it mean? And could they really be guineas, those<br/>
two glittering objects the interloper had held up to his (Billy's) <br/>
eyes? Where could the fellow get guineas? Why even buttons spare buttons<br/>
are not so plentiful at sea. The more he turned the<br/>
matter over, the more he was nonplussed, and made uneasy and<br/>
discomfited. In his disgustful recoil from an overture which<br/>
though he but ill comprehended he instinctively knew must in-<br/>
volve evil of some sort, Billy Budd was like a young horse fresh<br/>
from the pasture suddenly inhaling a vile whiff of some chemical<br/>
factory and by repeated snortings trying to get it out of his nos-<br/>
trils and lungs. This frame of mind barred all desire of holding<br/>
further parley with the fellow, even were it but for the purpose of<br/>
gaining some enlightenment as to his design in approaching him.<br/>
And yet he was not without natural curiosity to see how such a<br/>
visitor in the dark would look in broad day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He espied him the following afternoon in his first dog-watch<br/>
below one of the smokers on that forward part of the upper gun-<br/>
deck allotted to the pipe. He recognized him by his general cut <br/>
and build, more than by his round freckled face and glassy eyes<br/>
of pale blue, veiled with lashes all but white. And yet Billy was<br/>
a bit uncertain whether indeed it were he&mdash;yonder chap about his<br/>
own age, chatting and laughing in free-hearted way, leaning<br/>
against a gun; a genial young fellow enough to look at, and some-<br/>
thing of a rattle-brain, to all appearance. Rather chubby too for a<br/>
sailor even an afterguardsman. In short the last man in the world,<br/>
one would think, to be overburdened with thoughts, especially<br/>
those perilous thoughts that must needs belong to a conspirator in<br/>
any serious project, or even to the underling of such a conspir-<br/>
ator.<br/>
<br/>
Although Billy was not aware of it, the fellow, with one side-<br/>
long watchful glance had perceived Billy first, and then noting<br/>
that Billy was looking at him, thereupon nodded a familiar sort<br/>
of friendly recognition as to an old acquaintance, without inter-<br/>
rupting the talk he was engaged in with the group of smokers. A<br/>
day or two afterwards chancing in the evening promenade on a<br/>
gun-deck, to pass Billy, he offered a flying word of good-fellow-<br/>
ship as it were, which by its unexpectedness, and equivocalness<br/>
under the circumstances so embarrassed Billy that he knew not<br/>
how to respond to it, and let it go unnoticed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Billy was now left more at a loss than before. The ineffectual<br/>
speculations into which he was led were so disturbingly alien to<br/>
him that he did his best to smother them. It never entered<br/>
his mind that here was a matter which from its extreme question-<br/>
ableness, it was his duty as a loyal blue-jacket to report in the<br/>
proper quarter. And, probably, had such a step been suggested to<br/>
him he would have been deterred from taking it by the thought,<br/>
one of novice-magnanimity, that it would savor overmuch of the<br/>
dirty work of a tell-tale. He kept the thing to himself. Yet upon<br/>
one occasion, he could not forbear a little disburdening himself to<br/>
the old Dansker, tempted thereto perhaps by the influence of a<br/>
balmy night when the ship lay becalmed; the twain, silent for<br/>
the most part, sitting together on deck, their heads propped<br/>
against the bulwarks. But it was only a partial and anonymous<br/>
account that Billy gave, the unfounded scruples above referred to<br/>
preventing full disclosure to anybody. Upon hearing Billy's ver-<br/>
sion, the sage Dansker seemed to divine more than he was told;<br/>
and after a little meditation during which his wrinkles were<br/>
pursed as into a point, quite effacing for the time that quizzing<br/>
expression his face sometimes wore,&mdash;&ldquo;Didn't I say so, Baby<br/>
Budd?&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Say what?&rdquo; demanded Billy.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Why, Jemmy Legs is down on you.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;And what&rdquo; rejoined Billy in amazement, &ldquo;has Jemmy Legs to do<br/>
with that cracked afterguardsman?&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Ho, it was an afterguardsman, then. A cat's-paw, a cat's-paw!&rdquo;<br/>
And with that exclamation, which, whether it had reference to a<br/>
light puff of air just then coming over the calm sea, or subtler re-<br/>
lation to the afterguardsman, there is no telling, the old Merlin<br/>
gave a twisting wrench with his black teeth at his plug of to-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
bacco, vouchsafing no reply to Billy's impetuous question, though<br/>
now repeated, for it was his wont to relapse into grim silence<br/>
when interrogated in skeptical sort as to any of his sententious<br/>
oracles, not always very clear ones, but rather partaking of that <br/>
obscurity which invests most Delphic deliverances from any<br/>
quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Long experience had very likely brought this old man to that<br/>
bitter prudence which never interferes in aught and never gives<br/>
advice.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, despite the Dansker's pithy insistence as to the master-at-<br/>
arms being at the bottom of these strange experiences of Billy on<br/>
board the Indomitable, the young sailor was ready to ascribe them<br/>
to almost anybody but the man who, to use Billy's own expres-<br/>
sion, &ldquo;always had a pleasant word for him.&rdquo; This is to be won-<br/>
dered at. Yet not so much to be wondered at. In certain matters,<br/>
some sailors even in mature life remain unsophisticated enough.<br/>
But a young seafarer of the disposition of our athletic foretopman<br/>
is much of a child-man. And yet a child's utter innocence is but<br/>
its blank ignorance, and the innocence more or less wanes as<br/>
intelligence waxes. But in Billy Budd intelligence such as it was,<br/>
had advanced, while yet his simple-mindedness remained for the<br/>
most part unaffected. Experience is a teacher indeed; yet did<br/>
Billy's years make his experience small. Besides, he had none of<br/>
that intuitive knowledge of the bad which in natures not good or<br/>
incompletely so foreruns experience, and therefore may pertain,<br/>
as in some instances it too clearly does pertain, even to youth.<br/>
<br/>
And what could Billy know of man except of man as a mere <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
sailor? And the old-fashioned sailor, the veritable man-before-the-<br/>
mast, the sailor from boyhood up, he, though indeed of the same<br/>
species as a landsman is in some respects singularly distinct from<br/>
him. The sailor is frankness, the landsman is finesse. Life is<br/>
not a game with the sailor, demanding the long head; no intricate<br/>
game of chess where few moves are made in straightforwardness,<br/>
and ends are attained by indirection; an oblique, tedious, bar-<br/>
ren game hardly worth that poor candle burnt out in playing it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, as a class, sailors are in character a juvenile race. Even <br/>
their deviations are marked by juvenility. And this more espec-<br/>
ially holding true with the sailors of Billy's time. Then, too, cer-<br/>
tain things which apply to all sailors, do more pointedly operate<br/>
here and there, upon the junior one. Every sailor, too is accus-<br/>
tomed to obey orders without debating them; his life afloat is ex-<br/>
ternally ruled for him; he is not brought into that promiscuous<br/>
commerce with mankind where unobstructed free agency on <br/>
equal terms&mdash;equal superficially, at least&mdash;soon teaches one that<br/>
unless upon occasion he exercises a distrust keen in proportion to<br/>
the fairness of the appearance, some foul turn may be served him.<br/>
A ruled undemonstrative distrustfulness is so habitual, not with<br/>
business-men so much, as with men who know their kind in less<br/>
shallow relations than business, namely certain men-of-the-<br/>
world, that they come at last to employ it all but unconsciously;<br/>
and some pi them would very likely feel real surprise at being<br/>
charged with it as one of their general characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But after the little matter at the mess Billy Budd no more<br/>
found himself in strange trouble at times about his hammock or<br/>
his clothes-bag or what not. While, as to that smile that occasion-<br/>
ally sunned him, and the pleasant passing word, these were if<br/>
not more frequent, yet if anything more pronounced than before.<br/>
<br/>
But for all that, there were certain other demonstrations now.<br/>
When Claggart's unobserved glance happened to light on belted<br/>
Billy rolling along the upper gun-deck in the leisure of the sec-<br/>
ond dog-watch exchanging passing broadsides of fun with other<br/>
young promenaders in the crowd; that glance would follow the<br/>
cheerful sea-Hyperion with a settled meditative and melancholy<br/>
expression, his eyes strangely suffused with incipient feverish<br/>
tears. Then would Claggart look like the man of sorrows. Yes, <br/>
and sometimes the melancholy expression would have in it a<br/>
touch of soft yearning, as if Claggart could even have loved<br/>
Billy but for fate and ban. But this was an evanescence, and<br/>
quickly repented of, as it were, by an immitigable look, pinching<br/>
and shrivelling the visage into the momentary semblance of a<br/>
wrinkled walnut. But sometimes catching sight in advance of the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
foretopman coming in his direction, he would, upon their near-<br/>
ing, step aside a little to let him pass, dwelling upon Billy for the<br/>
moment with the glittering dental satire of a Guise. But upon<br/>
any abrupt unforeseen encounter a red light would flash forth<br/>
from his eye like a spark from an anvil in a dusk smithy. That<br/>
quick fierce light was a strange one, darted from orbs which in<br/>
repose were of a color nearest approaching a deeper violet, the<br/>
softest of shades.<br/>
<br/>
Though some of these caprices of the pit could not but be<br/>
observed by their object, yet were they beyond the construing of<br/>
such a nature. And the thews of Billy were hardly compar-<br/>
able with that sort of sensitive spiritual organization which in<br/>
some cases instinctively conveys to ignorant innocence an ad-<br/>
monition of the proximity of the malign. He thought the master-<br/>
at-arms acted in a manner rather queer at times. That was all.<br/>
But the occasional frank air and pleasant word went for what they<br/>
purported to be, the young sailor never having heard as yet of <br/>
the &ldquo;too fair-spoken man.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
Had the foretopman been conscious of having done or said<br/>
anything to provoke the ill will of the official, it would have been<br/>
different with him, and his sight might have been purged if not <br/>
sharpened. As it was innocence was his blinder.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So was it with him in yet another matter. Two minor officers&mdash;<br/>
the Armorer, and Captain of the Hold, with whom he had never<br/>
exchanged a word, his position on the ship not bringing him into<br/>
contact with them; these men now for the first began to cast<br/>
upon Billy when they chanced to encounter him, that peculiar<br/>
glance which evidences that the man from whom it comes has<br/>
been some way tampered with and to the prejudice of him upon<br/>
whom the glance lights. Never did it occur to Billy as a thing to<br/>
be noted or a thing suspicious, though he well knew the fact that<br/>
the Armorer and Captain of the Hold, with the ship's yeoman,<br/>
apothecary and others of that grade, were by naval usage, mess-<br/>
mates of the master-at-arms men with ears convenient to his con-<br/>
fidential tongue.<br/>
<br/>
But the general popularity that our Handsome Sailor's manly<br/>
forwardness upon occasion, and irresistible good nature indi-<br/>
cating no mental superiority tending to excite an invidious<br/>
feeling; this good will on the part of most of his shipmates<br/>
made him the less to concern himself about such mute aspects<br/>
toward him as those whereto allusion has just been made as far<br/>
as he could not so fathom as to infer their whole import.<br/>
<br/>
As to the afterguardsman, though Billy for reasons already<br/>
given necessarily saw little of him, yet when the two did happen<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
to meet, invariably came the fellow's offhand cheerful recogni-<br/>
tion, sometimes accompanied by a passing pleasant word or two. <br/>
Whatever that equivocal young person's original design may<br/>
really have been, or the design of which he might have been the<br/>
deputy, certain it was from his manner upon these occasions,<br/>
that he had wholly dropped it.<br/>
<br/>
It was as if his precocity of crookedness (and every vulgar vil-<br/>
lain is precocious ) had for once deceived him, and the man he<br/>
had sought to entrap as a simpleton had, through his very sim-<br/>
plicity ignorantly baffled him.<br/>
<br/>
But shrewd ones may opine that it was hardly possible for<br/>
Billy to refrain from going up to the afterguardsman and bluntly<br/>
demanding to know his purpose in the initial interview, so ab-<br/>
ruptly closed in the fore-chains. Shrewd ones may also think it<br/>
but natural in Billy to set about sounding some of the other <br/>
impressed men of the ship in order to discover what basis, if any,<br/>
there was for the emissary's obscure suggestions as to plotting <br/>
disaffection aboard. Yes, &lt;the&gt; shrewd may so think. But<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
something more, or rather, something else than mere shrewd-<br/>
ness is perhaps needful for the due understanding of such a char-<br/>
acter as Billy Budd's.<br/>
<br/>
As to Claggart, the monomania in the man&mdash;if that indeed it<br/>
were&mdash;as involuntarily disclosed by starts in the manifestations<br/>
detailed, yet in general covered over by his self-contained and<br/>
rational demeanor; this, like a subterranean fire was eating its<br/>
way deeper and deeper in him. Something decisive must come<br/>
of it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After the mysterious interview in the fore-chains, the one so<br/>
abruptly ended there by Billy, nothing especially germane to the<br/>
story occurred until the events now about to be narrated.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere it has been said that owing to the lack of frigates (of<br/>
course better sailers than line-of-battle ships) in the English<br/>
squadron up the Straits at that period, the Indomitable was oc-<br/>
casionally employed not only as an available substitute for a<br/>
scout, but at times on detached service of more important kind.<br/>
This was not alone because of her sailing qualities, not common<br/>
in a ship of her rate, but quite as much, probably, that the charac-<br/>
ter of her commander, it was thought, specially adapted him for<br/>
any duty where under unforeseen difficulties a prompt initiative<br/>
might have to be taken in some matter demanding knowledge<br/>
and ability in addition to those qualities implied in good seaman-<br/>
ship. It was on an expedition of the latter sort, a somewhat dis-<br/>
tant one, and when the Indomitable was almost at her furthest<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
remove from the fleet that in the latter part of an afternoon-<br/>
watch she unexpectedly came in sight of a ship of the enemy.<br/>
It proved to be frigate. The latter, perceiving through the glass<br/>
that the weight of men and metal would be heavily against her,<br/>
invoking her light heels crowded sail to get away. After a chase<br/>
urged almost against hope and lasting until about the middle of<br/>
the first dog-watch, she signally succeeded in effecting her escape.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after the pursuit had been given up, and ere the<br/>
excitement incident thereto had altogether waned away, the<br/>
master-at-arms ascending from his cavernous sphere made his ap-<br/>
pearance cap in hand by the mainmast respectfully awaiting the<br/>
notice of Captain Vere then solitary walking the weather-side of<br/>
the quarter-deck doubtless somewhat chafed at the failure of<br/>
the pursuit. The spot where Claggart stood was the place allotted<br/>
to the men of lesser grades when seeking some more particu-<br/>
lar interview either with the officer-of-the-deck or the Captain<br/>
himself. But from the latter it was not often that a sailor or<br/>
petty-officer of those days would seek a hearing; only some ex-<br/>
ceptional cause, would, according to established custom, have<br/>
warranted that.<br/>
<br/>
Presently, just as the Commander absorbed in his reflections<br/>
was on the point of turning aft in his promenade, he became sen-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
sible of Claggart's presence, and saw the doffed cap held in def-<br/>
erential expectancy. Here be it said that Captain Vere's personal<br/>
knowledge of this petty-officer had only begun at the time of the<br/>
ship's last sailing from home, Claggart then for the first, in trans-<br/>
fer from a ship detained for repairs, supplying on board the<br/>
Indomitable the place of a previous master-at-arms disabled<br/>
and ashore.<br/>
<br/>
No sooner did the Commander observe who it was that now<br/>
so deferentially stood awaiting his notice, than a peculiar ex-<br/>
pression came over him. It was not unlike that which uncon-<br/>
trollably will flit across the countenance of one at unawares en-<br/>
countering a person who though known to him indeed has hardly<br/>
been long enough known for thorough knowledge, but something<br/>
in whose aspect nevertheless now for the first provokes a<br/>
vaguely repellent distaste. But coming to a stand and resuming<br/>
much of his wonted official manner, save that a sort of impatience<br/>
lurked in the intonation of the opening word, he said, &ldquo;Well?<br/>
what is it, master-at-arms?&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
With the air of a subordinate grieved at the necessity of being<br/>
a messenger of ill tidings, and while conscientiously determined<br/>
to be frank, yet equally resolved upon shunning overstatement,<br/>
Claggart at this invitation or rather summons to disburden, spoke<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
up. What he said, conveyed in the language of no uneducated<br/>
man, was to the effect following if not altogether in these words,<br/>
namely, that during the chase and preparations for the possible<br/>
encounter he had seen enough to convince him that at least one<br/>
sailor aboard was a dangerous character in a ship mustering<br/>
some who not only had taken a guilty part in the late serious<br/>
troubles, but others also who, like the man in question, had en-<br/>
tered His Majesty's service under another form than enlistment.<br/>
<br/>
At this point Captain Vere with some impatience, interrupted<br/>
him:<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Be direct, man; say impressed men.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
Claggart made a gesture of subservience and proceeded.<br/>
<br/>
Quite lately whereof he (Claggart) had begun to suspect<br/>
that on the gun-decks some sort of movement prompted by the<br/>
sailor in question was covertly going on, but he had not thought<br/>
himself warranted in reporting the suspicion so long as it re-<br/>
mained indistinct. But from what he had that afternoon ob-<br/>
served in the man referred to the suspicion of something clan-<br/>
destine going on had advanced to a point less removed from<br/>
certainty. He deeply felt, he added, the serious responsibility as-<br/>
sumed in making a report involving such possible consequences<br/>
to the individual mainly concerned, besides tending to augment<br/>
those natural anxieties which every naval commander must feel<br/>
in view of extraordinary outbreaks so recent as those which, he<br/>
sorrowfully said it, it needed not to name.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now at the first broaching of the matter Captain Vere taken by<br/>
surprise, could not wholly dissemble his disquietude. But as Clag-<br/>
gart went on, the former's aspect changed into restiveness<br/>
under something in the witness's manner in giving his testi-<br/>
mony. However, he refrained from interrupting him. And Clag-<br/>
gart, continuing, concluded with this:<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;God forbid, your honor, that the Indomitable's should be the<br/>
experience of the&mdash;&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Never mind that!&rdquo; here peremptorily broke in the superior,<br/>
his face altering with anger, instinctively divining the ship that<br/>
the other was about to name, one in which the Nore Mutiny had<br/>
assumed a singularly tragical character that for a time jeopard-<br/>
ized the life of its Commander. Under the circumstances he <br/>
was indignant at the purposed allusion. When the commissioned<br/>
officers themselves were on all occasions very heedful how they<br/>
referred to the recent events, for a petty-officer unnecessarily to<br/>
allude to them in the presence of his Captain, this struck him as <br/>
a most immodest presumption. Besides, to his quick sense of self-<br/>
respect, it even looked under the circumstances something like<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
an attempt to alarm him. Nor at first was he without some sur-<br/>
prise that one who so far as he had hitherto come under his<br/>
notice had shown considerable tact in his function should in this<br/>
particular evince such lack of it.<br/>
<br/>
But these thoughts and kindred dubious ones flitting across <br/>
his mind were suddenly replaced by an intuitional surmise which<br/>
though as yet obscure in form served practically to affect his<br/>
reception of the ill tidings. Certain it is, that long versed in every-<br/>
thing pertaining to the complicated gun-deck life, which like<br/>
every other form of life has its secret mines and dubious side <br/>
the side popularly disclaimed, Captain Vere did not permit him-<br/>
self to be unduly disturbed by the general tenor of his subordi-<br/>
nate's report. Furthermore, if in view of recent events prompt<br/>
action should be taken at the first palpable sign of recurring in-<br/>
subordination, for all that, not judicious would it be, he<br/>
thought, to keep the idea of lingering disaffection alive by undue<br/>
forwardness in crediting an informer even if his own subordinate<br/>
and charged among other things with police surveillance of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the crew. This feeling would not perhaps have so prevailed with<br/>
him were it not that upon a prior occasion the patriotic zeal<br/>
officially evinced by Claggart had somewhat irritated him <br/>
as appearing rather supersensible and strained. Furthermore <br/>
something even in the official's self-possessed and somewhat os-<br/>
tentatious manner in making his specifications strangely re-<br/>
minded him of a bandsman, a perjured witness in a capital case<br/>
before a perjurous court-martial ashore of which when a lieu-<br/>
tenant he Captain Vere had been a member.<br/>
<br/>
Now the peremptory check given to Claggart in the matter of<br/>
the arrested allusion was quickly followed up by this: &ldquo;You say<br/>
that there is at least one dangerous man aboard. Name him.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;William Budd. A foretopman, your honor&mdash;&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;William Budd&rdquo; repeated Captain Vere with unfeigned aston-<br/>
ishment; &ldquo;and mean you the man that Lieutenant Ratcliffe<br/>
took from the merchantman not very long ago &mdash;the young fel-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
low who seems to be so popular with the men&mdash;Billy, the Hand-<br/>
some Sailor, as they call him?&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;The same, your honor; but for all his youth and good looks, a<br/>
deep one. Not for nothing does he insinuate himself into the good<br/>
will of his shipmates, since at the least all hands will at a pinch<br/>
say a good word for him at all hazards. Did Lieutenant Rat-<br/>
cliffe happen to tell your honor of that adroit fling of Budd's <br/>
jumping up in the cutter's bow under the merchantman's stern<br/>
when he was being taken off? It is even masqued by that sort of<br/>
good-humored air that at heart he resents his impressment. You<br/>
have but noted his fair cheek. A man-trap may be under his<br/>
ruddy-tipped daisies.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
Now the Handsome Sailor as a signal figure among the crew,<br/>
had naturally enough attracted the Captain's attention from the<br/>
first. Though in general not very demonstrative to his officers,<br/>
he had congratulated Lieutenant Ratcliffe upon his good fortune<br/>
in lighting on such a fine specimen of the genus homo who, in the<br/>
nude might have posed for a statue of young Adam before the<br/>
fall.<br/>
<br/>
As to Billy's adieu to the ship Rights-of-Man, which the board-<br/>
ing lieutenant had indeed reported to him&lt;,&gt; Captain Vere, but<br/>
in a deferential way more as a good story than aught else, though<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
mistakenly understanding it as a satiric sally, had but thought<br/>
so much the better of the impressed man for it; as a military<br/>
sailor, admiring the spirit that could take an arbitrary enlistment<br/>
so merrily and sensibly. The foretopman's conduct, too, so far<br/>
as it had fallen under the Captain's notice had confirmed the first<br/>
happy augury, while the new recruit's qualities as a sailor-man<br/>
seemed to be such that he had thought of recommending him to<br/>
the executive officer for promotion to a place that would more fre-<br/>
quently bring him under his own observation, namely, the cap-<br/>
taincy of the mizzen-top, replacing there in the starboard watch<br/>
a man not so young whom partly for that reason he deemed less<br/>
fitted for the post. Be it parenthesized here that since the mizzen-<br/>
top-men have not to handle such breadths of heavy canvas as the<br/>
lower sails on the main-mast and fore-mast, a young man if of<br/>
the right stuff not only seems best adapted to duty there, but in<br/>
fact is generally selected for the captaincy of that top, and the<br/>
company under him are light hands and often but striplings. In<br/>
sum, Captain Vere had from the beginning deemed Billy Budd to<br/>
be what in the naval parlance of the time was called a &ldquo; King's<br/>
bargain,&rdquo; that is to say, for His Britannic Majesty's navy a capital<br/>
investment at small outlay or none at all.<br/>
<br/>
After a brief pause during which the reminiscences above men-<br/>
tioned passed vividly through his mind he weighed the import of<br/>
Claggart's last suggestion, conveyed in the phrase, &ldquo;pitfall under<br/>
the clover,&rdquo; and the more he weighed it the less reliance he felt<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
in the informer's good faith. Suddenly he turned upon him and in<br/>
a low voice: &ldquo;Do you come to me, master-at-arms, with so foggy<br/>
a tale? As to Budd, cite me an act or spoken word of his con-<br/>
firmatory of what you in general charge against him. Stay,&rdquo;<br/>
drawing nearer to him &ldquo;heed what you speak. Just now and<br/>
in a case like this, there is a yard-arm-end for the false-witness.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Ah, your honor!&rdquo; sighed Claggart mildly shaking his shapely<br/>
head as in sad deprecation of such unmerited severity of tone.<br/>
Then, bridling&mdash;erecting himself as in virtuous self-assertion, he<br/>
circumstantially alleged certain words and acts, which collec-<br/>
tively if credited, led to presumptions mortally inculpating<br/>
Budd. And for some of these averments, he added, substan-<br/>
tiating proof was not far.<br/>
<br/>
With grey eyes impatient and distrustful essaying to fathom to<br/>
the bottom Claggart's calm violet ones, Captain Vere again heard<br/>
him out; then for the moment stood ruminating. The mood he<br/>
evinced, Claggart&mdash;himself for the time liberated from the oth-<br/>
er's scrutiny&mdash;steadily regarded with a look difficult to render,<br/>
&mdash;a look curious of the operation of his tactics, a look such as<br/>
might have been that of the spokesman of the envious children of<br/>
Jacob deceptively imposing upon the troubled patriarch the<br/>
blood-dyed coat of young Joseph.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Though something exceptional in the moral quality of Captain<br/>
Vere made him, in earnest encounter with a fellow-man, a veri-<br/>
table touch-stone of that man's essential nature, yet now as to<br/>
Claggart and what was really going on in him his feeling par-<br/>
took less of intuitional conviction than of strong suspicion<br/>
clogged by strange dubieties. The perplexity he evinced pro-<br/>
ceeded less from aught touching the man informed against&mdash;as<br/>
Claggart doubtless opined&mdash;than from considerations how best to<br/>
act in regard to the informer. At first indeed he was naturally for<br/>
summoning that substantiation of his allegations which Clag-<br/>
gart said was at hand. But such a proceeding would result in the<br/>
matter at once getting abroad which in the present stage of it, he<br/>
thought, might undesirably affect the ship's company. If Claggart<br/>
was a false witness,&mdash;that closed the affair. And therefore before<br/>
trying the accusation, he would first practically test the accuser;<br/>
and he thought this could be done in a quiet undemonstrative<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
The measure he determined upon involved a shifting of the<br/>
scene a transfer to a place less exposed to observation than the<br/>
broad quarter-deck. For although the few gun-room officers there<br/>
at the time had, in due observance of naval etiquette, withdrawn<br/>
to leeward the moment Captain Vere had begun his promenade<br/>
on the deck's weather-side; and though during the<br/>
colloquy with Claggart they of course ventured not to diminish the dis-<br/>
tance; and though throughout the interview Captain Vere's voice<br/>
was far from high, and Claggart's silvery and low; and the wind<br/>
in the cordage and the wash of the sea helped the more to put<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
them beyond ear-shot; nevertheless, the interview's continuance<br/>
already had attracted observation from some topmen aloft and<br/>
other sailors in the waist or further forward.<br/>
<br/>
Having determined upon his measures, Captain Vere forth-<br/>
with took action. Abruptly turning to Claggart he asked &ldquo;Mas-<br/>
ter-at-arms, is it now Budd's watch aloft?&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;No, your honor.&rdquo; Whereupon, &ldquo;Mr. Wilkes!&rdquo; summoning the<br/>
nearest midshipman, &ldquo;tell Albert to come to me.&rdquo; Albert was the<br/>
Captain's hammock-boy, a sort of sea-valet in whose discretion<br/>
and fidelity his master had much confidence. The lad appeared.<br/>
&ldquo;You know Budd the foretopman?&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;I do, Sir.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Go find him. It is his watch off. Manage to tell him out of ear-<br/>
shot that he is wanted aft. Contrive it that he speaks to nobody.<br/>
Keep him in talk yourself. And not till you get well aft here, not<br/>
till then let him know that the place where he is wanted is my<br/>
cabin. You understand. Go.&mdash;Master-at-arms, show yourself on<br/>
the decks below, and when you think it time for Albert to be com-<br/>
ing with his man, stand by quietly to follow the sailor in.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now when the foretopman found himself closeted there, as it<br/>
were, in the cabin with the Captain and Claggart, he was sur-<br/>
prised enough. But it was a surprise unaccompanied by apprehen-<br/>
sion or distrust. To an immature nature essentially honest and<br/>
humane, forewarning intimations of subtler danger from one's kind<br/>
come tardily if at all. The only thing that took shape in the<br/>
young sailor's mind was this: Yes, the Captain, I have always<br/>
thought, looks kindly upon me. Wonder if he's going to make me<br/>
his coxswain. I should like that. And maybe now he is going to<br/>
ask the master-at-arms about me.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Shut the door there, sentry,&rdquo; said the commander; &ldquo;standq<br/>
without and let nobody come in.&mdash;Now, master-at-arms, tell this<br/>
man to his face what you told of him to me;&rdquo; and stood prepared<br/>
to scrutinize the mutually confronting visages.<br/>
<br/>
With the measured step and calm collected air of an asylum<br/>
physician approaching in the public hall some patient beginning<br/>
to show indications of a coming paroxysm, Claggart deliberately<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
advanced within short range of Billy, and mesmerically looking<br/>
him in the eye, briefly recapitulated the accusation.<br/>
<br/>
Not at first did Billy take it in. When he did the rose-tan of<br/>
his cheek looked struck as by white leprosy. He stood like one<br/>
impaled and gagged. Meanwhile the accuser's eyes removing<br/>
not as yet from the blue dilated ones, underwent a phenomenal<br/>
change, their wonted rich violet color blurring into a muddy<br/>
purple. Those lights of human intelligence losing human expres-<br/>
sion, gelidly protruding like the alien eyes of certain uncata-<br/>
logued creatures of the deep. The first mesmeric glance was<br/>
one of surprised fascination; the last was as the hungry lurch<br/>
of the torpedo-fish.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Speak, man!&rdquo; said Captain Vere to the transfixed one struck by<br/>
his aspect even more than by Claggart's, &ldquo;Speak! defend your-<br/>
self.&rdquo; Which appeal caused but a strange dumb gesturing and<br/>
gurgling in Billy; amazement at such an accusation so suddenly<br/>
sprung on inexperienced nonage; this, and it may be horror at<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the accuser, serving to bring but his lurking defect and in this<br/>
instance for the time intensifying it into a convulsed tongue-<br/>
tie; while the intent head and entire form straining forward in an<br/>
agony of ineffectual eagerness to obey the injunction to speak and<br/>
defend himself, gave an expression to the face like that of a con-<br/>
demned vestal priestess in the moment of being buried alive,<br/>
and in the first struggle against suffocation.<br/>
<br/>
Though at the time Captain Vere was quite ignorant of Billy's<br/>
liability to vocal impediment, he now immediately divined it,<br/>
since vividly Billy's aspect recalled to him that of a bright young<br/>
schoolmate of his whom he had seen struck by much the same<br/>
startling impotence in the act of eagerly rising in the class to be<br/>
foremost in response to a testing question put to it by the master.<br/>
Going close up to the young sailor, and laying a soothing hand on<br/>
his shoulder, he said&lt;:&gt; &ldquo;There is no hurry, my boy. Take your<br/>
time, take your time.&rdquo; Contrary to the effect intended, these words<br/>
so fatherly in tone, doubtless touching Billy's heart to the quick,<br/>
prompted yet more violent efforts at utterance&mdash;efforts soon end-<br/>
ing for the time in confirming the paralysis, and bringing to the<br/>
face an expression which was as a crucifixion to behold. The next<br/>
instant, quick as the flame from a discharged cannon at night, <br/>
his right arm shot out, and Claggart dropped to the deck. Whether<br/>
intentionally or but owing to the young athlete's superior height,<br/>
the blow had taken effect full upon the forehead, so shapely and<br/>
intellectual-looking a feature in the master-at-arms; so that the<br/>
body fell over lengthwise, like a heavy plank tilted from erect-<br/>
ness. A gasp or two and he lay motionless.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Fated boy,&rdquo; breathed Captain Vere in tone so low as to be al-<br/>
most a whisper, &ldquo;what have you done! But here, help me.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
The twain raised the felled one from the loins up into a sitting<br/>
position. The spare form flexibly acquiesced, but inertly. It was<br/>
like handling a dead snake. They lowered it back. Regaining<br/>
erectness Captain Vere with one hand covering his face stood to<br/>
all appearance as impassive as the object at his feet. Was he ab-<br/>
sorbed in taking in all the bearings of the event and what was best<br/>
not only now at once to be done, but also in the sequel? Slowly<br/>
he uncovered his face; and the effect was as if the moon emerging<br/>
from eclipse should reappear with quite another aspect than that<br/>
which had gone into hiding. The father in him, manifested to-<br/>
wards Billy thus far in the scene, was replaced by the military <br/>
disciplinarian. In his official tone he bade the foretopman retire<br/>
to a state-room aft (pointing it out) and there remain till thence<br/>
summoned. This order Billy in silence mechanically obeyed. <br/>
Then, going to the cabin door where it opened on the quarter-<br/>
deck, Captain Vere said to the sentry without, &ldquo;Tell somebody to<br/>
send Albert here.&rdquo; When the lad appeared his master so contrived<br/>
it that he should not catch sight of the prone one. &ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; he<br/>
said to him, &ldquo;tell the Surgeon I wish to see him. You need not<br/>
come back till called.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
When the Surgeon entered&mdash;a self-poised character of that<br/>
grave sense and experience that hardly anything could take him<br/>
aback, &mdash;Captain Vere advanced to meet him, thus unconsciously<br/>
interrupting his view of Claggart and interrupting the other's<br/>
wonted ceremonious salutation, said, &ldquo;Nay, tell me how it is<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
with yonder man,&rdquo; directing his attention to the prostrate one.<br/>
<br/>
The Surgeon looked, and for all his self-command, somewhat<br/>
started at the abrupt revelation. On Claggart's always pallid <br/>
complexion, thick black blood was now oozing from mouth and<br/>
ear. To the gazer's professional eye it was unmistakably no living<br/>
man that he saw.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Is it so then?&lt;&rdquo;&gt; said Captain Vere intently watching him.<br/>
&ldquo;I thought it. But verify it.&rdquo; Whereupon the customary tests con-<br/>
firmed the Surgeon's first glance, who now looking up in un-<br/>
feigned concern, cast a look of intense inquisitiveness upon his<br/>
superior. But Captain Vere, with one hand to his brow was<br/>
standing motionless. Suddenly, catching the Surgeon's arm con-<br/>
vulsively, he exclaimed pointing down to the body&mdash;&ldquo;It is the<br/>
divine judgment of Ananias! Look!&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
Disturbed by the excited manner he had never before observed<br/>
in the Indomitable's Captain, and as yet wholly ignorant of the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
affair, the prudent Surgeon nevertheless held his peace, only<br/>
again looking an earnest interrogation as to what it was that had<br/>
resulted in such a tragedy.<br/>
<br/>
But Captain Vere was now again motionless standing ab-<br/>
sorbed in thought. But again starting, he vehemently exclaimed&mdash;<br/>
&ldquo;Struck dead by an angel of God. Yet the angel must hang!&lt;&rdquo;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At these passionate interjections, mere incoherences to the<br/>
listener as yet unapprised of the antecedent events, the Surgeon<br/>
was profoundly discomfited. But now as recollecting himself, <br/>
Captain Vere in less harsh tone briefly related the circumstances<br/>
leading up to the event.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;But come; we must despatch&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Help me to remove<br/>
him (meaning the body) to yonder compartment,&rdquo; designating<br/>
one opposite that where the foretopman remained immured.<br/>
Anew disturbed by a request that as implying a desire for secrecy,<br/>
seemed unaccountably strange to him, there was nothing for the<br/>
subordinate to do but comply.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Go now&rdquo; said Captain Vere with something of his wonted man-<br/>
ner, &ldquo;Go now. I shall presently call a drumhead court. Tell the<br/>
lieutenants what has happened, and tell Mr. Mordant,&rdquo; meaning<br/>
the captain of marines, &ldquo;and charge them to keep the matter to<br/>
themselves.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Full of disquietude and misgivings the Surgeon left the cabin.<br/>
Was Captain Vere suddenly affected in his mind, or was it but a<br/>
transient excitement brought about by so strange and extraor-<br/>
dinary happening? As to the drumhead court, it struck the Sur-<br/>
geon as impolitic, if nothing more. The thing to do, he thought,<br/>
was to place Billy Budd in confinement, and in a way dictated by<br/>
usage, and postpone further action in so extraordinary a case to<br/>
such time as they should again join the squadron, and then refer<br/>
it to the Admiral. He recalled the unwonted agitation of Captain<br/>
Vere and his excited exclamations so at variance with his normal<br/>
manner. Was he unhinged? But assuming that he is, it is not so<br/>
susceptible to proof. What then could he do? No more trying<br/>
situation is conceivable than that of an officer subordinated under<br/>
a Captain whom he suspects to be, not mad indeed, but yet not<br/>
quite unaffected in his intellect. To argue his order to him would<br/>
be insolence. To resist him would be mutiny. In obedience to<br/>
Captain Vere he communicated what had happened to the lieu-<br/>
tenants and captain of marines saying nothing as to the Captain's<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
state. They fully stared at him in surprise and concern. Like him<br/>
they seemed to think that such a matter should be reported to<br/>
the Admiral.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who in the rainbow can draw the line where the violet tint ends and the orange tint<br/>
begins? Distinctly we see the differ-<br/>
ence of the color, but where exactly does the one first visibly en-<br/>
ter into the other? So with sanity and insanity. In pronounced<br/>
cases there is no question about them. But in some supposed<br/>
cases, in various degrees supposedly less pronounced, to draw<br/>
the exact line of demarkation few will undertake though for a fee<br/>
some professional experts will. There is nothing namable but that<br/>
some men will undertake to do it for pay.<br/>
<br/>
Whether Captain Vere, as the Surgeon professionally and pri-<br/>
marily surmised, was really the sudden victim of any degree of<br/>
aberration, one must determine for himself by such light as this<br/>
narrative may afford.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;That&gt; the unhappy event which has been narrated could<br/>
not have happened at a worse juncture was but too true. For<br/>
it was close on the heel of the suppressed insurrections, an after-<br/>
time very critical to naval authority, demanding from every<br/>
English sea-commander two qualities not readily interfusable&mdash;<br/>
prudence and rigor. Moreover there was something crucial in the<br/>
case.<br/>
<br/>
In the jugglery of circumstances preceding and attending the<br/>
event on board the Indomitable and in the light of martial code<br/>
whereby it was formally to be judged, innocence and guilt per-<br/>
sonified in Claggart and Budd&mdash;in effect changed places.<br/>
<br/>
In the legal view the apparent victim of the tragedy was he who<br/>
had sought to victimize a man blameless; and the indisputable<br/>
deed of the latter, navally regarded, constituted the most hein-<br/>
ous of military crimes. Yet more. The essential right and wrong<br/>
involved in the matter, the clearer that might be, so much the<br/>
worse for the responsibility of a loyal sea- commander inasmuch<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
as he was not authorized to determine the matter on that primi-<br/>
tive basis.<br/>
<br/>
Small wonder then that the Indomitable's Captain though in<br/>
general a man of rapid decision, felt that circumspectness not<br/>
less than promptitude was necessary. Until he could decide upon<br/>
his course, and in each detail; and not only so, but until the con-<br/>
cluding measure was upon the point of being enacted, he<br/>
deemed it advisable, in view of all the circumstances to guard as<br/>
much as possible against publicity. Here he may or may not have<br/>
erred. Certain it is however that subsequently in the confidential<br/>
talk of more than one or two gun-rooms and cabins he was not<br/>
a little criticized by some officers, a fact imputed by his friends,<br/>
and vehemently by his cousin Jack Denton, to professional jeal-<br/>
ousy of Starry Vere. Some imaginative ground for invidious com-<br/>
ment there was. The maintenance of secrecy in the matter, the<br/>
confining all knowledge of it for a time to the place where the<br/>
homicide occurred, the quarter-deck cabin; in these particulars<br/>
lurked some resemblance to the policy adopted in those trage-<br/>
dies of the palace which have occurred more than once in the<br/>
capital founded by Peter the Barbarian.<br/>
<br/>
The case indeed was such that fain would the Indomitable's<br/>
Captain have deferred taking any action whatever respecting it<br/>
further than to keep the foretopman a close prisoner till the ship<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
rejoined the squadron and then submitting the matter to the<br/>
judgment of his Admiral.<br/>
<br/>
But a true military officer is in one particular like a true monk.<br/>
Not with more of self-abnegation will the latter keep his vows of<br/>
monastic obedience than the former his vows of allegiance to<br/>
martial duty.<br/>
<br/>
Feeling that unless quick action were taken on it, the deed of<br/>
the foretopman, so soon as it should be known on the gun-decks <br/>
would tend to awaken any slumbering embers of the Nore <br/>
among the crew, a sense of the urgency of the case overruled in<br/>
Captain Vere every other consideration. But though a conscien-<br/>
tious disciplinarian he was no lover of authority for mere author-<br/>
ity's sake. Very far was he from embracing opportunities for mo-<br/>
nopolizing to himself the perils of moral responsibility none at<br/>
least that could properly be referred to an official superior or<br/>
shared with him by his official equals or even subordinates. So<br/>
thinking he was glad it would not be at variance with usage to<br/>
turn the matter over to a summary court of his own officers, re-<br/>
serving to himself as the one on whom the ultimate accountability<br/>
would rest, the right of maintaining a supervision of it, or formally<br/>
or informally interposing at need. Accordingly a drumhead<br/>
court was summarily convened, he electing the individuals com-<br/>
posing it, the First Lieutenant, the Captain of marines, and the<br/>
Sailing Master.<br/>
<br/>
In associating an officer of marines with the sea-lieutenants in<br/>
a case having to do with a sailor the Commander perhaps deviated<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
from general custom. He was prompted thereto by the circum-<br/>
stance that he took that soldier to be a judicious person, thought-<br/>
ful, and not altogether incapable of grappling with a difficult<br/>
case unprecedented in his prior experience. Yet even as to him he<br/>
was not without some latent misgiving, for withal he was an<br/>
extremely good-natured man, an enjoyer of his dinner a sound<br/>
sleeper, and inclined to obesity. &lt;A&gt; man who though he<br/>
would always maintain his manhood in battle might not prove<br/>
altogether reliable in a moral dilemma involving aught of the<br/>
tragic. As to the First Lieutenant and the Sailing Master Cap-<br/>
tain Vere could not but be aware that though honest natures, of<br/>
approved gallantry upon occasion their intelligence was mostly<br/>
confined to the matter of active seamanship and the fighting de-<br/>
mands of their profession. The court was held in the same cabin<br/>
where the unfortunate affair had taken place. This cabin, the<br/>
Commander's, embraced the entire area under the poop-deck.<br/>
Aft, and on either side was a small state-room the one room<br/>
temporarily a jail and the other a dead-house and a yet smaller<br/>
compartment leaving a space between expanding forward into<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
a goodly oblong of length coinciding with the ship's beam. A sky-<br/>
light of moderate dimension was overhead and at each end of the<br/>
oblong space were two sashed port-hole windows easily convert-<br/>
ible back into embrasures for short carronades.<br/>
<br/>
All being quickly in readiness, Billy Budd was arraigned, Cap-<br/>
tain Vere necessarily appearing as the sole witness in the case, and<br/>
as such temporarily sinking his rank, though singularly main-<br/>
taining it in a matter apparently trivial, namely, that he testified<br/>
from the ship's weather-side with that object having caused the<br/>
court to sit on the lee-side. Concisely he narrated all that had led<br/>
up to the catastrophe, omitting nothing in Claggart's accusation<br/>
and deposing as to the manner in which the prisoner had received<br/>
it. At this testimony the three officers glanced with no little sur-<br/>
prise at Billy Budd, the last man they would have suspected either<br/>
of mutinous design alleged by Claggart, or of the undeniable deed<br/>
he himself had done. The First Lieutenant, taking judicial pri-<br/>
macy and turning toward the prisoner, said, &ldquo;Captain Vere has<br/>
spoken. Is it or is it not as Captain Vere says?&rdquo; In response came<br/>
syllables not so much impeded in the utterance as might have<br/>
been anticipated. They were these: &ldquo;Captain Vere tells the truth.<br/>
It is just as Captain Vere says, but it is not as the master-in-arms<br/>
said. I have eaten the King's bread and I am true to the King.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;I believe you, my man,&rdquo; said the witness his voice indicating<br/>
a suppressed emotion not otherwise betrayed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;God will bless you for that, your honor!&rdquo; not without stam-<br/>
mering said Billy, and all but broke down. But immediately was<br/>
recalled to self-control by another question, to which with the<br/>
same emotional difficulty of utterance he said &ldquo;No, there was no<br/>
malice between us. I never bore malice against the master-at-<br/>
arms. I am sorry that he is dead. I did not mean to kill him. Could<br/>
I have used my tongue I would not have struck him. But he foully<br/>
lied to my face and in the presence of my Captain, and I had to<br/>
say something, and I could only say it with a blow, God help me!&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
In the impulsive above-board manner of the frank one the<br/>
court saw confirmed all that was implied in words that just pre-<br/>
viously had perplexed them coming as they did from the testifier<br/>
to the tragedy and promptly following Billy's impassioned dis-<br/>
claimer of mutinous intent&mdash;Captain Vere's words, &ldquo;I believe you,<br/>
my man.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
Next it was asked of him whether he knew of or suspected<br/>
aught savoring of incipient trouble (meaning mutiny, though the<br/>
explicit term was avoided) going on in any section of the ship's<br/>
company.<br/>
<br/>
The reply lingered. This was naturally imputed by the court to<br/>
the same vocal embarrassment which had retarded or obstructed<br/>
previous answers. But in main it was otherwise here; the ques-<br/>
tion immediately recalling to Billy's mind the interview with the<br/>
afterguardsman in the fore-chains. But an innate repugnance to<br/>
playing a part at all approaching that of an informer against one's<br/>
own shipmates&mdash;the same erring sense of uninstructed honor<br/>
which had stood in the way of his reporting the matter at the time<br/>
though as a loyal man-of-war-man it was incumbent on him and<br/>
failure so to do if charged against him and proven, would have<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
subjected him to the heaviest of penalties; this, with the blind<br/>
feeling now his, that nothing really was being hatched, prevail-<br/>
ing with him. When the answer came it was a negative.<br/>
<br/>
&rdquo;One question more,&rdquo; said the officer of marines now first speak-<br/>
ing and with a troubled earnestness, &ldquo;You tell us that what the<br/>
master-at-arms said against you was a lie. Now why should he<br/>
have so lied, so maliciously lied, since you declare there was no<br/>
malice between you?&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
At that question unintentionally touching on a spiritual<br/>
sphere wholly obscure to Billy's thoughts, he was nonplussed,<br/>
evincing a confusion indeed that some observers, such as can<br/>
readily be imagined, would have construed into involuntary evi-<br/>
dence of hidden guilt. Nevertheless he strove some way to an-<br/>
swer, but all at once relinquished the vain endeavor, at the same<br/>
time turning an appealing glance towards Captain Vere as deem-<br/>
ing him his best helper and friend. Captain Vere who had been<br/>
seated for a time, rose to his feet, addressing the interrogator. <br/>
&ldquo;The question you put to him comes naturally enough. But can<br/>
he rightly answer it? Or anybody else? Unless indeed it be he who<br/>
lies within there&rdquo; designating the compartment where lay the<br/>
corpse. &ldquo;But the prone one there will not rise to our summons.<br/>
In effect though, as it seems to me, the point you make is hardly <br/>
material. Quite aside from any conceivable motive actuating the<br/>
master-at-arms, and irrespective of the provocation of the blow, a<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
martial court must needs in the present case confine its attention<br/>
to the blow's consequence, which consequence is to be deemed<br/>
not otherwise than as justly the striker's deed.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
This utterance the full significance of which it was not at all<br/>
likely that Billy took in, nevertheless caused him to turn a wistful<br/>
interrogative look towards the speaker, a look in its dumb expres-<br/>
siveness not unlike that which a dog of generous breed might<br/>
turn upon his master seeking in his face some elucidation of a<br/>
previous gesture ambiguous to the canine intelligence. Nor was<br/>
the same utterance without marked effect upon the three officers,<br/>
more especially the soldier. Couched in it seemed to them a mean-<br/>
ing unanticipated, involving a prejudgment on the speaker's<br/>
part. It served to augment a mental disturbance previously evident<br/>
enough.<br/>
<br/>
The soldier once more spoke; in a tone of suggestive dubiety<br/>
addressing at once his associates and Captain Vere: &ldquo;Nobody is<br/>
present&mdash;none of the ship's company, I mean, who might shed<br/>
lateral light, if any is to be had, upon what remains mysterious in<br/>
this matter.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;That is thoughtfully put&rdquo; said Captain Vere; &ldquo;I see your drift.<br/>
Ay, there is a mystery; but to use a Scriptural phrase, it is &lsquo;a mys-<br/>
tery of iniquity,&rsquo; a matter for psychologic theologians to discuss.<br/>
But what has a military court to do with it? Not to add that for<br/>
us any possible investigation of it is cut off by the lasting tongue-<br/>
tie of&mdash;him&mdash;in yonder,&rdquo; again designating the mortuary state-<br/>
room. &ldquo;The prisoner's deed,&mdash;with that alone we have to do.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
To this, and particularly the closing reiteration, the marine sol-<br/>
dier knowing not how aptly to reply, sadly abstained from saying<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
aught. The First Lieutenant who at the outset had not unnatu-<br/>
rally assumed primacy in the court, now overrulingly instructed<br/>
by a glance from Captain Vere, a glance more effective than<br/>
words, resumed that primacy. Turning to the prisoner, &ldquo;Budd,&rdquo; he<br/>
said, and scarce in equable tones, &ldquo;Budd, if you have aught further<br/>
to say for yourself, say it now.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
Upon this the young sailor turned another quick glance to-<br/>
wards Captain Vere; then, as taking a hint from that aspect, a<br/>
hint confirming his own instinct that silence was now best, re-<br/>
plied to the Lieutenant, &ldquo;I have said all, Sir.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
The marine&mdash;the same who had been the sentinel without the<br/>
cabin-door at the time that the foretopman followed by the mas-<br/>
ter-at-arms, entered it&mdash;he, standing by the sailor throughout their<br/>
judicial proceedings, was now directed to take him back to the<br/>
after compartment originally assigned to the prisoner and his cus-<br/>
todian. As the twain disappeared from view, the three officers as<br/>
partially liberated from some inward constraint associated with<br/>
Billy's mere presence, simultaneously stirred in their seats. They<br/>
exchanged looks of troubled indecision, yet feeling that decide<br/>
they must and without long delay. For Captain Vere &lt;was&gt;<br/>
for the time standing unconsciously with his back towards them,<br/>
apparently in one of his absent fits, gazing out from a sashed port-<br/>
hole to windward upon the monotonous blank of the twilight <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
sea. But the court's silence continuing, broken only at moments<br/>
by brief consultations in low earnest tones, this seemed to assure<br/>
him and encourage him. Turning, he to-and-fro paced the cabin<br/>
athwart; in the returning ascent to windward, climbing the slant<br/>
deck in the ship's lee roll; without knowing it symbolizing thus in<br/>
his action a mind resolute to surmount difficulties even if against<br/>
primitive instincts strong as the wind and the sea. Presently he<br/>
came to a stand before the three. After scanning their faces he<br/>
stood less as mustering his thoughts for expression, than as one <br/>
inly deliberating how best to put them to well-meaning men not<br/>
intellectually mature, men with whom it was necessary to demon-<br/>
strate certain principles that were axioms to himself. Similar <br/>
impatience as to talking is perhaps one reason that deters some<br/>
minds from addressing any popular assemblies.<br/>
<br/>
When speak he did, something both in the substance of what<br/>
he said and his manner of saying it, showed the influence of un-<br/>
shared studies modifying and tempering the practical training of<br/>
an active career. This, along with his phraseology now and then <br/>
was suggestive of the grounds whereon rested that imputation of<br/>
a certain pedantry socially alleged against him by certain naval<br/>
men of wholly practical cast, captains who nevertheless would<br/>
frankly concede that His Majesty's navy mustered no more efficient offi-<br/>
cers of their grade than &ldquo; Starry Vere.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What he said was to this effect: &ldquo;Hitherto I have been but the<br/>
witness, little more; and I should hardly think now to take an-<br/>
other tone, that of your coadjutor, for the time, did I not perceive<br/>
in you &mdash;at the crisis too&mdash;a troubled hesitancy, proceeding, I<br/>
doubt not from the clashing of military duty with moral <br/>
scruple&mdash;scruple vitalized by compassion. For the compassion<br/>
how can I otherwise than share it. But, mindful of para-<br/>
mount obligation I strive against scruples that may tend to<br/>
enervate decision. Not, gentlemen, that I hide from myself that<br/>
the case is an exceptional one. Speculatively regarded, it well<br/>
might be referred to a jury of casuists. But for us here acting<br/>
not as casuists or moralists, it is a case practical and under martial<br/>
law practically to be dealt with.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;But your scruples: do they move as in a dusk? Challenge them.<br/>
Make them advance and declare themselves. Come now: do<br/>
they import something like this: If, mindless of palliating circum-<br/>
stances we are bound to regard the death of the master-at-arms as<br/>
the prisoner's deed, then does that deed constitute a capital<br/>
crime whereof the penalty is a mortal one. But in natural justice<br/>
is nothing but the prisoner's overt act to be considered? How<br/>
can we adjudge to summary and shameful death a fellow-crea-<br/>
ture innocent before God, and whom we feel to be so?&mdash;Does<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
that state it aright? You sign sad assent. Well, I too feel that,<br/>
the full force of that. It is Nature. But do these buttons that we<br/>
wear attest that our allegiance is to Nature? No, to the King.<br/>
Though the ocean, which is inviolate Nature primeval, though<br/>
this be the element where we move and have our being as sail-<br/>
ors, yet as the King's officers lies our duty in a sphere correspond-<br/>
ingly natural? So little is that true, that in receiving our commis-<br/>
sions we in the most important regards ceased to be natural<br/>
free-agents. When war is declared, are we the commissioned<br/>
fighters previously consulted? We fight at command. If our judg-<br/>
ments approve the war, that is but coincidence. So in other par-<br/>
ticulars. So now. For suppose condemnation were to follow<br/>
these present proceedings. Would it be so much we ourselves<br/>
that would condemn as it would be martial law operating through<br/>
us? For that law and the rigor of it, we are not responsible. Our<br/>
vowed responsibility is in this: That however pitilessly that law<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
may operate, we nevertheless adhere to it and administer it.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;But the exceptional in the matter moves the heart within<br/>
you. Even so too is mine moved. But let not warm hearts betray<br/>
heads that should be cool. Ashore in a criminal case will an up-<br/>
right judge allow himself off the bench to be waylaid by some<br/>
tender kinswoman of the accused seeking to touch him with her<br/>
tearful plea? Well the heart sometimes the feminine in man,<br/>
here is &lt;as&gt; that piteous woman. And hard though it be, she<br/>
must here be ruled out.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
He paused, earnestly studying them for a moment; then re-<br/>
sumed.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;But something in your aspect seems to urge that it is not solely<br/>
that heart that moves in you, but also the conscience, the private<br/>
conscience. But tell me whether or not, occupying the position<br/>
we do, private conscience should not yield to that imperial one<br/>
formulated in the code under which alone we officially pro-<br/>
ceed?&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
Here the three men moved in their seats, less convinced than <br/>
agitated by the course of an argument troubling but the more<br/>
the spontaneous conflict within. Perceiving which, the speaker<br/>
paused for a moment; then abruptly changing his tone, went<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;To steady us a bit, let us recur to the facts.&mdash;In war-time at<br/>
sea a man-of-war's-man strikes his superior in grade, and the blow<br/>
kills. Apart from its effect the blow itself is, according to the Ar-<br/>
ticles of War, a capital crime. Furthermore&mdash;&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Ay, Sir,&rdquo; emotionally broke in the officer of marines, &ldquo;in one<br/>
sense it was. But surely Budd purposed neither mutiny nor<br/>
homicide.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Surely not, my good man. And before a court less arbitrary and<br/>
more merciful than a martial one that plea would largely extenu-<br/>
ate. At the Last Assizes it shall acquit. But how here? We pro-<br/>
ceed under the law of the Mutiny Act. In feature no child can<br/>
resemble his father more than that Act resembles in spirit the<br/>
thing from which it derives&mdash;War. In His Majesty&lt;'s&gt;<br/>
service&mdash;in this ship indeed&mdash;there are Englishmen forced to fight for<br/>
the King against their will. Against their conscience, for aught<br/>
we know. Though as their fellow-creatures some of us may ap-<br/>
preciate their position, yet as Navy Officers, what reck we of it?<br/>
Still less recks the enemy. Our impressed men he would fain<br/>
cut down in the same swath with our volunteers. As regards the<br/>
enemy's naval conscripts, some of whom may even share our own<br/>
abhorrence of the regicidal French Directory, it is the same on<br/>
our side. War looks but to the frontage, the appearance. And the<br/>
Mutiny Act, War's child, takes after the father. Budd's intent or<br/>
non-intent is nothing to the purpose.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;But while, put to it by those anxieties in you which I cannot<br/>
but respect, I only repeat myself&mdash;while thus strangely we pro-<br/>
long proceedings that should be summary&mdash;the enemy may be<br/>
sighted and an engagement result. We must do; and one of two<br/>
things must we do&mdash;condemn or let go.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Can we not convict and yet mitigate the penalty?&rdquo; asked the<br/>
junior Lieutenant here speaking, and falteringly, for the first.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Lieutenant, were that clearly lawful for us under the circum-<br/>
stances consider the consequence of such clemency. The people&rdquo; <br/>
<br/>
(meaning the ship's company) &ldquo;have native sense; most of<br/>
them are familiar with our naval usage and tradition; and how<br/>
would they take it? Even could you explain to them&mdash;which our<br/>
official position forbids&mdash;they, long moulded by arbitrary disci-<br/>
pline have not that kind of intelligent responsiveness that might <br/>
qualify them to comprehend and discriminate. No, to the people<br/>
the foretopman's deed, however it be worded in the announce-<br/>
ment will be plain homicide committed in a flagrant act of mu-<br/>
tiny. What penalty for that should follow, they know. But it does<br/>
not follow. Why? They will ruminate. You know what sailors<br/>
are. Will they not revert to the recent outbreak at the Nore? Ay,<br/>
they know the well-founded alarm&mdash;the panic it struck through-<br/>
out England. Your clement sentence they would account pusil-<br/>
lanimous. They would think that we flinch, that we are afraid of<br/>
them&mdash;afraid of practicing a lawful rigor singularly demanded at<br/>
this juncture lest it should provoke new troubles. What shame<br/>
to us such a conjecture on their part, and how deadly to disci-<br/>
pline. You see then, whither prompted by duty and the law I<br/>
steadfastly drive. But I beseech you, my friends, do not take me<br/>
amiss. I feel as you do for this unfortunate boy. But did he<br/>
know our hearts, I take him to be of that generous nature that he<br/>
would feel even for us on whom in this military necessity so heavy<br/>
a compulsion is laid.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
With that, crossing the deck he resumed his place by the sashed<br/>
port-hole, tacitly leaving the three to come to a decision. On the<br/>
cabin's opposite side the troubled court sat silent. Loyal lieges, <br/>
plain and practical, though at bottom they dissented from some<br/>
points Captain Vere had put to them, they were without the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
faculty, hardly had the inclination to gainsay one whom they felt<br/>
to be an earnest man, one too not less their superior in mind than<br/>
in naval rank. But it is not improbable that even such of his<br/>
words as were not without influence over them, less came home<br/>
to them than his closing appeal to their instinct as sea-officers<br/>
in the forethought he threw out as to the practical consequences<br/>
to discipline, considering the unconfirmed tone of the fleet at the<br/>
time should a man-of-war's-man's violent killing at sea of a su-<br/>
perior in grade be allowed to pass for aught else than a capital<br/>
crime demanding prompt infliction of the penalty.<br/>
<br/>
Not unlikely they were brought to something more or less akin<br/>
to that harassed frame of mind which in the year 1842 actuated<br/>
the commander of the U.S. brig-of-war Somers to resolve, under<br/>
the so-called Articles of War&lt;,&gt; Articles modelled upon the<br/>
English Mutiny Act, to resolve upon the execution at sea of a<br/>
midshipman and two petty-officers as mutineers designing the<br/>
seizure of the brig. Which resolution was carried out though in a<br/>
time of peace and within not many days sail of home. An act vin-<br/>
dicated by a naval court of inquiry subsequently convened ashore.<br/>
History, and here cited without comment. True, the circum-<br/>
stances on board the Somers were different from those on board<br/>
the Indomitable. But the urgency felt, well-warranted or other-<br/>
wise, was much the same.<br/>
<br/>
Says a writer whom few know, &ldquo;Forty years after a battle it<br/>
is easy for a non-combatant to reason about how it ought to have<br/>
been fought. It is another thing personally and under fire to di-<br/>
rect the fighting while involved in the obscuring smoke of it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Much so with respect to other emergencies involving considera-<br/>
tions both practical and moral, and when it is imperative promptly<br/>
to act. The greater the fog the more it imperils the steamer, and<br/>
speed is put on though at the hazard of running somebody down.<br/>
Little ween the snug card-players in the cabin of the responsibil-<br/>
ities of the sleepless man on the bridge.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
In brief, Billy Budd was formally convicted and sentenced to<br/>
be hung at the yard-arm in the early morning-watch, it being now<br/>
night. Otherwise, as is customary in such cases, the sentence<br/>
would forthwith have been carried out. In war-time on the<br/>
field or in the fleet, a mortal punishment decreed by a drumhead<br/>
court&mdash;on the field sometimes decreed by but a nod from the<br/>
General&mdash;follows without a delay on the heel of conviction with-<br/>
out appeal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was Captain Vere himself who of his own motion communi-<br/>
cated the finding of the court to the prisoner; for that purpose<br/>
going to the compartment where he was in custody and bidding<br/>
the marine there to withdraw for the time.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the communication of the sentence what took place at<br/>
this interview was never known. But in view of the character of<br/>
the twain briefly closeted in that stateroom, each radically sharing<br/>
in the rarer qualities of one nature&mdash;so rare indeed as to be all<br/>
but incredible to average minds however much cultivated&mdash;<br/>
some conjectures may be ventured.<br/>
<br/>
It would have been in consonance with the spirit of Captain<br/>
Vere should he on this occasion have concealed nothing from the<br/>
condemned one&mdash;should he indeed have frankly disclosed to him<br/>
the part he himself had played in bringing about the decision, at<br/>
the same time revealing his actuating motives. On Billy's side it<br/>
is not improbable that such a confession would have been re-<br/>
ceived in much the same spirit that prompted it. Not without a<br/>
sort of joy indeed he might have appreciated the brave opinion<br/>
of him implied in his Captain making such a confidant of him.<br/>
Nor, as to the sentence itself could he have been insensible that<br/>
it was imparted to him as to one not afraid to die. Even more may<br/>
have been. Captain Vere in &lt;the&gt; end may have developed the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
passion sometimes latent under an exterior stoical or indifferent. <br/>
He was old enough to have been Billy's father. The austere devo-<br/>
tee of military duty letting himself melt back into what remains <br/>
primeval in our formalized humanity may in &lt;the&gt; end have<br/>
caught Billy to his heart even as Abraham may have caught<br/>
young Isaac on the brink of resolutely offering him up in obedi-<br/>
ence to the exacting behest. But there is no telling the sacra-<br/>
ment, seldom if in any case revealed to the gadding world wher-<br/>
ever under circumstances at all akin to those here attempted to be<br/>
set forth two of great Nature's nobler order embrace. There is<br/>
privacy at the time, inviolable to the survivor, and holy oblivion<br/>
the sequel to each diviner magnanimity, providentially covers all<br/>
at last.<br/>
<br/>
The first to encounter Captain Vere in act of leaving the com-<br/>
partment was the senior Lieutenant. The face he beheld, for the<br/>
moment one expressive of the agony of the strong, was to that<br/>
officer, though a man of fifty, a startling revelation. That the<br/>
condemned one suffered less than he who mainly had effected the<br/>
condemnation was apparently indicated by the former's exclama-<br/>
tion in the scene soon perforce to be touched upon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of a series of incidents within a brief term rapidly following each<br/>
other, the adequate narration may take up a term less brief,<br/>
especially if explanation or comment here and there seem requi-<br/>
site to the better understanding of such incidents. Between the<br/>
entrance into the cabin of him who never left it alive, and him<br/>
who when he did leave it left it as one condemned to die; be-<br/>
tween this and the closeted interview just given less than an hour<br/>
and a half had elapsed. It was an interval long enough however<br/>
to awaken speculations among no few of the ship's company as to<br/>
what it was that could be detaining in the cabin the master-at-<br/>
arms and the sailor; for a rumor that both of them had been seen<br/>
to enter it and neither of them had been seen to emerge, this ru-<br/>
mor had got abroad upon the gun-decks and in the tops; the<br/>
people of a great warship being in one respect like villagers, tak-<br/>
ing microscopic note of every outward movement or non-move-<br/>
ment going on. When therefore in weather not at all tempestu-<br/>
ous all hands were called in the second dog-watch, a summons<br/>
under such circumstances not usual in those hours, the crew <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
were not wholly unprepared for some announcement extraordi-<br/>
nary, one having connection too with the continued absence of<br/>
the two men from their wonted haunts.<br/>
<br/>
There was a moderate sea at the time; and the moon, newly<br/>
risen and near to being at its full, silvered the white spar-deck <br/>
wherever not blotted by the clear-cut shadows horizontally<br/>
thrown of fixtures and moving men. On either side the quarter-<br/>
deck the marine guard under arms was drawn up; and Captain<br/>
Vere standing in his place surrounded by all the ward-room offi-<br/>
cers, addressed his men. In so doing his manner showed neither<br/>
more nor less than that properly pertaining to his supreme posi-<br/>
tion aboard his own ship. In clear terms and concise he told<br/>
them what had taken place in the cabin; that the master-at-arms<br/>
was dead; that he who had killed him had been already tried by<br/>
a summary court and condemned to death; and that the execu-<br/>
tion would take place in the early morning watch. The word mu-<br/>
tiny was not named in what he said. He refrained too from making<br/>
the occasion an opportunity for any preachment as to the main-<br/>
tenance of discipline, thinking perhaps that under existing cir-<br/>
cumstances in the navy the consequence of violating discipline<br/>
should be made to speak for itself.<br/>
<br/>
Their Captain's announcement was listened to by the throng of<br/>
standing sailors in a dumbness like that of a seated congregation<br/>
of believers in hell listening to the clergyman's announcement of<br/>
his Calvinistic text.<br/>
<br/>
At the close, however, a confused murmur went up. It began to<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
wax. All but instantly, then, at a sign, &lt;it&gt; was pierced and<br/>
suppressed by shrill whistles of the Boatswain and his mates<br/>
piping down one watch.<br/>
<br/>
To be prepared for burial Claggart's body was delivered to<br/>
certain petty-officers of his mess. And here, not to clog the sequel<br/>
with lateral matters, it may be added that at a suitable hour, <br/>
the master-at-arms was committed to the sea with every funeral<br/>
honor properly belonging to his naval grade.<br/>
<br/>
In this proceeding as in every public one growing out of the<br/>
tragedy strict adherence to usage was observed. Nor in any point<br/>
could it have been at all deviated from either with respect to<br/>
Claggart or Billy Budd without begetting undesirable specula-<br/>
tions in the ship's company, sailors, and more particularly men-<br/>
of-war's men, being of all men the greatest sticklers for usage.<br/>
<br/>
For similar cause all communication between Captain Vere and<br/>
the condemned one ended with the closeted interview already<br/>
given, the latter being now surrendered to the ordinary routine<br/>
preliminary to the end. This transfer under guard from the Cap-<br/>
tain's quarters was effected without unusual precautions&mdash;at least<br/>
no visible ones.<br/>
<br/>
If possible not to let the men so much as surmise that their of-<br/>
ficers anticipate aught amiss from them is the tacit rule in a mili-<br/>
tary ship. And the more that some sort of trouble should really<br/>
be apprehended the more do the officers keep that apprehension<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
to themselves; though not the less unostentatious vigilance may<br/>
be augmented.<br/>
<br/>
In the present instance the sentry placed over the prisoner had<br/>
strict orders to let no one have communication with him but the<br/>
Chaplain. And certain unobtrusive measures were taken abso-<br/>
lutely to insure this point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In a seventy-four of the old order the deck known as the upper<br/>
gun-deck was the one covered over by the spar-deck which last<br/>
though not without its armament was for the most part exposed<br/>
to the weather. In general it was at all hours free from hammocks;<br/>
those of the crew swinging on the lower gun-deck, and berth-<br/>
deck, the latter being not only a dormitory but also the place for<br/>
the stowing of the sailors' bags, and on both sides lined with<br/>
the large chests or movable pantries of the many messes of the<br/>
men.<br/>
<br/>
On the starboard side of the Indomitable's upper gun-deck,<br/>
behold Billy Budd under sentry lying prone in irons in one of the<br/>
bays formed by the regular spacing of the guns comprising the<br/>
batteries on either side. All these pieces were of the heavier<br/>
caliber of that period. Mounted on lumbering wooden carriages<br/>
they were hampered with cumbersome harness of breeching and<br/>
strong side-tackles for running them out. Guns and carriages, to-<br/>
gether with the long rammers and shorter lintstocks lodged<br/>
in loops overhead&mdash;all these, as customary, were painted black; and<br/>
the heavy hempen breechings tarred to the same tint, wore the<br/>
like livery of the undertakers. In contrast with the funereal tone<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
of these surroundings the prone sailor's exterior apparel, white<br/>
jumper and white duck trousers, each more or less soiled,<br/>
dimly glimmered in the obscure light of the bay like a patch of dis-<br/>
colored snow in early April lingering at some upland cave's black<br/>
mouth. In effect he is already in his shroud or the garments that<br/>
shall serve him in lieu of one. Over him but scarce illuminating<br/>
him, two battle-lanterns swing from two massive beams of the<br/>
deck above. Fed with the oil supplied by the war-contractors<br/>
(whose gains, honest or otherwise, are in every land an antici-<br/>
pated portion of the harvest of death) with flickering splashes of<br/>
dirty yellow light they pollute the pale moonshine all but ineffect-<br/>
ually struggling in obstructed flecks through the open ports from<br/>
which the tompioned cannon protrude. Other lanterns at intervals<br/>
serve but to bring out somewhat the obscurer bays which like<br/>
small confessionals or side-chapels in a cathedral branch from<br/>
the long dim-vistaed broad aisle between the two batteries of that<br/>
covered tier.<br/>
<br/>
Such was the deck where now lay the Handsome Sailor.<br/>
Through the rose-tan of his complexion, no pallor could have<br/>
shown. It would have taken days of sequestration from the winds<br/>
and the sun to have brought about the effacement of that. But<br/>
the skeleton in the cheek-bone at the point of its angle was just<br/>
beginning delicately to be defined under the warm-tinted skin.<br/>
In fervid hearts self-contained some brief experiences devour<br/>
our human tissue as secret fire in a ship's hold consumes cotton in<br/>
the bale.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But now lying between the two guns, as nipped in the vice of<br/>
fate, Billy's agony, mainly proceeding from a generous young<br/>
heart's virgin experience of the diabolical incarnate and effec-<br/>
tive in some men&mdash;the tension of that agony was over now. <br/>
It survived not the something healing in the closeted interview<br/>
with Captain Vere. Without movement, he lay as in a trance.<br/>
That adolescent expression previously noted as his, taking on <br/>
something akin to the look of a child slumbering in the cradle<br/>
when the warm hearth-glow of the still chamber at night plays<br/>
on the dimples that at whiles mysteriously form in the cheek,<br/>
silently coming and going there. For now and then in the gyved<br/>
one's trance a serene happy light born of some wandering rem-<br/>
iniscence or dream would diffuse itself over his face, and then<br/>
wane away only anew to return.<br/>
<br/>
The Chaplain coming to see him and finding him thus, and per-<br/>
ceiving no sign that he was conscious of his presence, attentively<br/>
regarded him for a space, then slipping aside, withdrew for the<br/>
time, peradventure feeling that even he the minister of Christ <br/>
though receiving his stipend from Mars had no consolation to<br/>
proffer which could result in a peace transcending that which <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
he beheld. But in the small hours he came again. And the pris-<br/>
oner now awake to his surroundings noticed his approach and<br/>
civilly, all but cheerfully, welcomed him. But it was to little pur-<br/>
pose that in the interview following the good man sought to<br/>
bring Billy Budd to some Godly understanding that he must die,<br/>
and at dawn. True, Billy himself freely referred to his death as<br/>
a thing close at hand; but it was something in the way that chil-<br/>
dren will refer to death in general, who yet among their other<br/>
sports will play a funeral with hearse and mourners.<br/>
<br/>
Not that like children Billy was incapable of conceiving what<br/>
death really is. No, but he was wholly without irrational fear of<br/>
it, a fear more prevalent in highly civilized communities than<br/>
those so-called barbarous ones which in all respects stand nearer<br/>
to unadulterate Nature. And, as elsewhere said, a barbarian<br/>
Billy radically was; as much so, for all the costume, as his country-<br/>
men the British captives, living trophies, made to march in the<br/>
Roman triumph of Germanicus. Quite as much so as those later<br/>
barbarians, young men probably, and picked specimens among<br/>
the earlier British converts to Christianity, at least nominally<br/>
such and taken to Rome (as today converts from lesser isles of<br/>
the sea may be taken to London) of whom the Pope of that<br/>
time, admiring the strangeness of their personal beauty so unlike<br/>
the Italian stamp, their clear ruddy complexions and curled flaxen<br/>
locks, exclaimed, &ldquo;Angles&rdquo; (meaning English the modern de-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
rivative) &ldquo;Angles do you call them? And is it because they look so<br/>
like angels?&rdquo; Had it been later in time one would think that the<br/>
Pope had in mind Fra Angelico's seraphs some of whom, pluck-<br/>
ing apples in gardens of the Hesperides have the faint rosebud<br/>
complexion of the more beautiful English girls.<br/>
<br/>
If in vain the good Chaplain sought to impress the young bar-<br/>
barian with ideas of death akin to those conveyed in the skull,<br/>
dial and cross-bones on old tombstones; equally futile to all ap-<br/>
pearance were his efforts to bring home to him the thought of<br/>
salvation and a Saviour. Billy listened, but less out of awe or rev-<br/>
erence perhaps than from a certain natural politeness; doubt-<br/>
less at bottom regarding all that in much the same way that most<br/>
mariners of his class take any discourse abstract or out of the com-<br/>
mon tone of the work-a-day world. And this sailor way of taking<br/>
clerical discourse is not wholly unlike the way in which the<br/>
pioneer of Christianity full of transcendent miracles was re-<br/>
ceived long ago on tropic isles by any superior savage so called<br/>
&mdash;a Tahitian say of Captain Cook's time or shortly after that time.<br/>
Out of natural courtesy he received but did not appropriate.<br/>
It was like a gift placed in the palm of an outstretched hand<br/>
upon which the fingers do not close.<br/>
<br/>
But the Indomitable's Chaplain was a discreet man possessing<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the good sense of a good heart. So he insisted not in his voca-<br/>
tion here. At the instance of Captain Vere, a lieutenant had ap-<br/>
prised him of pretty much of everything as to Billy; and since he<br/>
felt that innocence was even a better thing than religion where-<br/>
with to go to Judgment, he reluctantly withdrew; but in his emo-<br/>
tion not without first performing an act strange enough in an<br/>
Englishman, and under the circumstances yet more so in any reg-<br/>
ular priest. Stooping over, he kissed on the fair cheek his fellow<br/>
man, a felon in martial law, one who though in the confines of<br/>
death he felt he could never convert to a dogma; nor for all that<br/>
did he fear for his future.<br/>
<br/>
Marvel not that having been acquainted with the young sailor's<br/>
essential innocence (an irruption of heretic thought hard to sup-<br/>
press) the worthy man lifted not a finger to avert the doom of<br/>
such a martyr to martial discipline. So to do would not only have<br/>
been as idle as invoking the desert, but would also have been an<br/>
audacious transgression of the bounds of his function, one as ex-<br/>
actly prescribed to him by military law as that of the boatswain<br/>
&lt;or&gt; any other naval officer. Bluntly put, a chaplain is the<br/>
minister of the Prince of Peace serving in the host of the God of<br/>
War&mdash;Mars. As such, he is as incongruous as that musket of<br/>
Bl&uuml;cher etc. at Christmas. Why then is he<br/>
there? Because he indirectly subserves the purpose attested by the cannon; because<br/>
too he lends the sanction of the religion of the meek to that<br/>
which practically is the abrogation of everything but brute force.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The night so luminous on the spar-deck but otherwise on the<br/>
cavernous ones below, levels so like the tiered galleries in a coal-<br/>
mine&mdash;the luminous night passed away. But, like the prophet in the<br/>
chariot disappearing in heaven and dropping his mantle to<br/>
Elisha, the withdrawing night transferred its pale robe to the<br/>
breaking day. A meek shy light appeared in the East, where<br/>
stretched a diaphanous fleece of white furrowed vapor. That<br/>
light slowly waxed. Suddenly eight bells was struck aft, re-<br/>
sponded to by one louder metallic stroke from forward. It was <br/>
four o'clock in the morning. Instantly the silver whistles were<br/>
heard summoning all hands to witness punishment. Up through<br/>
the great hatchways rimmed with racks of heavy shot, the watch<br/>
below came pouring overspreading with the watch already on<br/>
deck the space between the mainmast and foremast including<br/>
that occupied by the capacious launch and the black booms tiered<br/>
on either side of it, boat and booms making a summit of observa-<br/>
tion for the powder- boys and younger tars. A different group<br/>
comprising one watch of topmen leaned over the side of the rail<br/>
of that sea-balcony, no small one in a seventy-four, looking down<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
on the crowd below. Man or boy none spake but in whisper,<br/>
and few spake at all. Captain Vere&mdash;as before, the central figure<br/>
among the assembled commissioned officers&mdash;stood nigh the<br/>
break of the poop-deck facing forward. Just below him on the<br/>
quarter-deck the marines in full equipment were drawn up much<br/>
as at the scene of the promulgated sentence.<br/>
<br/>
At sea in the old time, the execution by halter of a military<br/>
sailor was generally from the fore-yard. In the present instance for<br/>
special reasons the main-yard was assigned. Under an arm<br/>
of that weather or lee &lt;?&gt; yard the prisoner was presently<br/>
brought up, the Chaplain attending him. It was noted at the time<br/>
and remarked upon afterwards, that in this final scene the good<br/>
man evinced little or nothing of the perfunctory. Brief speech in-<br/>
deed he had with the condemned one, but the genuine Gospel<br/>
was less on his tongue than in his aspect and manner towards<br/>
him. The final preparations personal to the latter being speedily<br/>
brought to an end by two boatswain's-mates, the consummation <br/>
impended. Billy stood facing aft. At the penultimate moment,<br/>
his words, his only ones, words wholly unobstructed in the utter-<br/>
ance were these&mdash;&ldquo;God bless Captain Vere!&rdquo; Syllables so unan-<br/>
ticipated coming from one with the ignominious hemp about<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
his neck&mdash;a conventional felon's benediction directed aft to-<br/>
wards the quarters of honor; syllables too delivered in the clear<br/>
melody of a singing-bird on the point of launching from the<br/>
twig, had a phenomenal effect, not unenhanced by the rare per-<br/>
sonal beauty of the young sailor spiritualized now through late<br/>
experiences so poignantly profound.<br/>
<br/>
Without volition as it were, as if indeed the ship's populace<br/>
were the vehicles of some vocal current electric, with one voice<br/>
from alow and aloft, came a resonant sympathetic echo&mdash;&ldquo;God<br/>
bless Captain Vere!&rdquo; And yet at that instant Billy alone must<br/>
have been in their hearts, even as he was in their eyes.<br/>
<br/>
At the pronounced words and the spontaneous echo that volu-<br/>
minously rebounded them, Captain Vere, either through stoic<br/>
self-control or a sort of momentary paralysis induced by emo-<br/>
tional shock, stood erectly rigid as a musket in the ship-armorer's <br/>
rack.<br/>
<br/>
The hull deliberately recovering from the periodic roll to lee-<br/>
ward was just regaining an even keel, when the last signal the<br/>
preconcerted dumb one was given. At the same moment it<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
chanced that the vapory fleece hanging low in the East, was shot<br/>
through with a soft glory as of the fleece of the Lamb of God<br/>
seen in mystical vision and simultaneously therewith, watched<br/>
by the wedged mass of upturned faces, Billy ascended; and as-<br/>
cending, took the full rose of the dawn.<br/>
<br/>
In the pinioned figure arrived at the yard-end, to the wonder of<br/>
all no motion was apparent save that created by the ship's mo-<br/>
tion, in moderate weather so majestic in a great ship ponder-<br/>
ously cannoned.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When some days afterwards in reference to the singularity just<br/>
mentioned, the Purser a rather ruddy rotund person more ac-<br/>
curate as an accountant than profound as a philosopher said at<br/>
mess to the Surgeon, &ldquo;What testimony to the force lodged in will-<br/>
power&rdquo; the latter saturnine&mdash;spare and tall, one in whom a dis-<br/>
creet causticity went along with a manner less genial than polite,<br/>
replied, &ldquo;Your pardon, Mr. Purser. In a hanging scientifically con-<br/>
ducted&mdash;and under special orders I myself directed how Budd's<br/>
was to be effected&mdash;any movement following the completed sus-<br/>
pension and originating in the body suspended, such movement <br/>
indicates mechanical spasm in the muscular system. Hence the absence of that<br/>
is no more attributable to will-power as you call<br/>
it than to horsepower&mdash;begging your pardon.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;But this muscular spasm you speak of, is not that in a degree<br/>
more or less invariable in these cases?&lt;&rdquo;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Assuredly so, Mr. Purser.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;How then, my good Sir, do you account for its absence in this<br/>
instance?&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Mr. Purser, it is clear that your sense of the singularity in this<br/>
matter equals not mine. You account for it by what you call will-<br/>
power a term not yet included in the lexicon of science. For me I<br/>
do not, with my present knowledge pretend to account for it<br/>
at all. Even should one assume the hypothesis that at the first<br/>
touch of the halyards the action of Budd's heart, intensified by<br/>
extraordinary emotion at its climax, abruptly stopped&mdash;much like<br/>
a watch when in carelessly winding it up you strain at the finish,<br/>
thus snapping the chain&mdash;even under that hypothesis how ac-<br/>
count for the phenomenon that followed?&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;You admit then that the absence of spasmodic movement was<br/>
phenomenal.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;It was phenomenal, Mr. Purser, in the sense that it was an ap-<br/>
pearance the cause of which is not immediately to be assigned.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;But tell me, my dear Sir,&rdquo; pertinaciously continued the other,<br/>
&ldquo;was the man's death effected by the halter, or was it a species of<br/>
euthanasia &lt;?&gt;&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo; Euthanasia, Mr. Purser, is something like your will-power; I<br/>
doubt its authenticity as a scientific term&mdash;begging your pardon<br/>
again. It is at once imaginative and metaphysical,&mdash;in short,<br/>
Greek. But&rdquo; abruptly changing his tone, &ldquo;there is a case in the<br/>
sick-bay which I do not care to leave to my assistants. Beg your<br/>
pardon, but excuse me.&rdquo; And rising from the mess he formally<br/>
withdrew.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The silence at the moment of execution and for a moment or<br/>
two continuing thereafter, a silence but emphasized by the reg-<br/>
ular wash of the sea against the hull or the flutter of a sail caused<br/>
by the helmsman's eyes being tempted astray, this emphasized<br/>
silence was gradually disturbed by a sound not easily to be here<br/>
verbally rendered. Whoever has heard the freshet-wave of a<br/>
torrent suddenly swelled by pouring showers in the tropical<br/>
mountains, showers not shared by the plain; whoever has heard<br/>
the first muffled murmur of its sloping advance through precipi-<br/>
tous woods, may form some conception of the sound now heard.<br/>
The seeming remoteness of its source was because of its murmur-<br/>
ous indistinctness since it came from close by, even from the men<br/>
massed on the ship's open deck. Being inarticulate, it was dubious<br/>
in significance further that it seemed to indicate some capricious<br/>
revulsion of thought or feeling such as mobs ashore are liable to<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
in the present instance possibly implying a sullen revocation on<br/>
the men's part of their involuntary echoing of Billy's benediction.<br/>
But ere the murmur had time to wax into clamor it was met<br/>
by a strategic command, the more telling that it came with abrupt<br/>
unexpectedness.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Pipe down the starboard watch Boatswain, and see that they <br/>
go.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
Shrill as the shriek of the sea-hawk the whistles of the Boat-<br/>
swain and his Mates pierced that ominous low sound, dissipat-<br/>
ing it; and yielding to the mechanism of discipline the throng was<br/>
thinned by one half. For the remainder most of them were set to <br/>
temporary employments connected with trimming the yards and<br/>
so forth, business readily to be got up to serve occasion by any<br/>
officer-of-the-deck.<br/>
<br/>
Now each proceeding that follows a mortal sentence pro-<br/>
nounced at sea by a drumhead court is characterized by a promp-<br/>
titude not perceptibly merging into hurry, though bordering<br/>
that. The hammock, the one which had been Billy's bed when<br/>
alive, having already been ballasted with shot and otherwise<br/>
prepared to serve for his canvas coffin, the last offices of the sea-<br/>
undertakers, the Sailmaker's Mates, were now speedily completed.<br/>
When everything was in readiness a second call for all hands<br/>
made necessary by the strategic movement before mentioned <br/>
was sounded and now to witness burial.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The details of this closing formality it needs not to give. But<br/>
when the tilted plank let slide its freight into the sea, a second<br/>
strange human murmur was heard, blended now with another<br/>
inarticulate sound proceeding from certain larger sea-fowl<br/>
whose attention having been attracted by the peculiar commo-<br/>
tion in the water resulting from the heavy sloped dive of the<br/>
shotted hammock into the sea flew screaming to the spot. So<br/>
near the hull did they come, that the stridor or bony creak of their<br/>
gaunt double-jointed pinions was audible. As the ship under light<br/>
airs passed on, leaving the burial spot astern, they still kept cir-<br/>
cling it low down with the moving shadow of their outstretched<br/>
wings and the cracked requiem of their cries.<br/>
<br/>
Upon sailors as superstitious as those of the age preceding ours,<br/>
men-of-war's men too who had just beheld the prodigy of repose<br/>
in the form suspended in air and now foundering in the deeps; <br/>
to such mariners the action of the sea-fowl though dictated by a<br/>
mere animal greed for prey, was big with no prosaic signifi-<br/>
cance. An uncertain movement began among them, in which<br/>
some encroachment was made. It was tolerated but for a moment.<br/>
For suddenly the drum beat to quarters, which familiar sound<br/>
happening at least twice a day, had upon the present occasion<br/>
some signal peremptoriness in it. True martial discipline long<br/>
continued superinduces in an average man a sort of impulse of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
docility whose operation at the official sound of command much<br/>
resembles in its promptitude the effect of an instinct.<br/>
<br/>
The drum-beat dissolved the multitude, distributing most of<br/>
them along the batteries of the two covered gun-decks. There, as<br/>
wont, the gun's crews stood by their respective cannon erect and<br/>
silent. In due course the First officer, sword under arm and stand-<br/>
ing in his place on the quarter-deck formally received the suc-<br/>
cessive reports of the sworded Lieutenants commanding the sec-<br/>
tions of batteries below; the last of which reports being made the<br/>
summed report he delivered with the customary salute to the<br/>
Commander. All this occupied time, which, in the present case,<br/>
was the object of beating to quarters at an hour prior to the cus-<br/>
tomary one. That such variance from usage was authorized by<br/>
an officer like Captain Vere, a martinet as some deemed him, was<br/>
evidence of the necessity for unusual action implied in what he<br/>
deemed to be temporarily the mood of his men. &ldquo;With mankind&rdquo;<br/>
he would say &ldquo;forms, measured forms are everything; and that<br/>
is the import couched in the story of Orpheus with his lyre spell-<br/>
binding the wild denizens of the woods.&rdquo; And this he once ap-<br/>
plied to the disruption of forms going on across the Channel and<br/>
the consequences thereof.<br/>
<br/>
At this unwonted muster at quarters, all proceeded as at the<br/>
regular hour. The band on the quarter-deck played a sacred air.<br/>
After which the Chaplain went through with the customary morn-<br/>
ing service. That done, the drum beat the retreat, and toned by<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
music and religious rites subserving the discipline and pur-<br/>
pose of war, the men in their wonted orderly manner dispersed<br/>
to the places allotted them when not at the guns.<br/>
<br/>
And now it was full day. The fleece of low-hanging vapor had<br/>
vanished, licked up by the sun that late had so glorified it. And the<br/>
circumambient air in the clearness of its serenity was like smooth<br/>
white marble in the polished block not yet removed from the<br/>
marble-dealer's yard.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The symmetry of form attainable in pure fiction cannot so read-<br/>
ily be achieved in a narration essentially having less to do with<br/>
fable than with fact. Truth uncompromisingly told will always<br/>
have its ragged edges; hence the conclusion of such a narration<br/>
is apt to be less finished than an architectural finial.<br/>
<br/>
How it fared with the Handsome Sailor during the year of the<br/>
great mutiny has been faithfully given. But though properly the<br/>
story ends with his life something in way of sequel will not<br/>
be amiss. Three brief chapters will suffice.<br/>
<br/>
In the general re-christening under the Directory of the craft<br/>
originally forming the navy of the French Monarchy, the St. Louis<br/>
line-of-battle ship was named the Ath&eacute;iste. Such a name, like<br/>
some other substituted ones in the Revolutionary fleet while pro-<br/>
claiming the infidel audacity of the ruling power was yet, though<br/>
not so intended to be, the aptest name, if one consider it, ever<br/>
given to a warship; far more so indeed than the Devastation, the<br/>
Erebus (the Hell) and similar names bestowed upon fighting-<br/>
ships.<br/>
<br/>
On the return passage to the English fleet from the detached<br/>
cruise during which occurred the events already recorded, the<br/>
Indomitable fell in with the Ath&eacute;iste. An engagement ensued;<br/>
during which Captain Vere in the act of putting his ship along-<br/>
side the enemy with a view of throwing his boarders across the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
bulwarks, was hit by a musket-ball from a port-hole of the en-<br/>
emy's main cabin. More than disabled he dropped to the deck<br/>
and was carried below to the same cock-pit where some of his<br/>
men already lay. The senior Lieutenant took command. Under<br/>
him the enemy was finally captured and though much crippled<br/>
was by rare good fortune successfully taken into Gibraltar, an<br/>
English port not very distant from the scene of the fight. There,<br/>
Captain Vere with the rest of the wounded was put ashore. He<br/>
lingered for some days, but the end came. Unhappily he was cut<br/>
off too early for the Nile and Trafalgar. The spirit that spite its<br/>
philosophic austerity may yet have indulged in the most secret<br/>
of all passions, ambition, never attained to the fullness of fame.<br/>
<br/>
Not long before death while lying under the influence of that<br/>
magical drug which soothing the physical frame mysteriously<br/>
operates on the subtler element in man, he was heard to murmur<br/>
words inexplicable to his attendant&mdash;&ldquo;Billy Budd, Billy Budd.&rdquo;<br/>
That these were not the accents of remorse, would seem clear<br/>
from what the attendant said to the Indomitable's senior officer<br/>
of marines who as the most reluctant to condemn of the members<br/>
of the drumhead court, too well knew though here he kept the<br/>
knowledge to himself, who Billy Budd was.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some few weeks after the execution, among other matters un-<br/>
der the main head of News from the Mediterranean, there ap-<br/>
peared in a naval chronicle of the time, an authorized weekly pub-<br/>
lication, an account of the affair. It was doubtless for the most<br/>
part written in good faith, though the medium, partly rumor,<br/>
through which the facts must have reached the writer, served to<br/>
deflect and in part falsify them. The account was as follows:&mdash;<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;On the tenth of the last month a deplorable occurrence took<br/>
place on board H.M.S. Indomitable. John Claggart, the ship's<br/>
master-at-arms, discovering that some sort of plot was incipient <br/>
among an inferior section of the ship's company, and that the ring-<br/>
leader was one William Budd; he, Claggart in the act of ar-<br/>
raigning the man before the Captain was vindictively stabbed<br/>
to the heart by the suddenly drawn sheath-knife of Budd.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&ldquo;&gt;The deed and the implement employed, sufficiently sug-<br/>
gest that though mustered into the service under an English name,<br/>
the assassin was no Englishman, but one of those aliens adopting<br/>
English cognomens whom the present extraordinary necessities<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
of the Service have caused to be admitted into it in considerable<br/>
numbers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&ldquo;&gt;The enormity of the crime and the extreme depravity of<br/>
the criminal, appear the greater in view of the character of the<br/>
victim, a middle-aged man respectable and discreet, belonging to<br/>
that minor official grade, the petty-officers, upon whom, as none<br/>
know better than the commissioned gentlemen, the efficiency of<br/>
His Majesty's navy so largely depends. His function was a respon-<br/>
sible one; at once onerous and thankless and his fidelity in it the<br/>
greater because of his strong patriotic impulse. In this instance<br/>
as in so many other instances in these days, the character of this<br/>
unfortunate man signally refutes, if refutation were needed, that<br/>
peevish saying attributed to the late Dr. Johnson, that patriotism<br/>
is the last refuge of a scoundrel.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&ldquo;&gt;The criminal paid the penalty of his crime. The prompti-<br/>
tude of the punishment has proved salutary. Nothing amiss is<br/>
now apprehended aboard the H.M.S. Indomitable.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
The above item appearing in a publication now long ago super-<br/>
annuated and forgotten is all that hitherto has stood in human <br/>
record to attest what manner of men respectively were John<br/>
Claggart and Billy Budd&lt;.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everything is for a term remarkable in navies. Any tangible<br/>
object associated with some striking incident of the service is<br/>
converted into a monument. The spar from which the foretopman<br/>
was suspended, was for some few years kept trace of by the blue-<br/>
jackets. Then knowledge followed it from ship to dock-yard and<br/>
again from dock-yard to ship, still pursuing it even when at last <br/>
reduced to a mere dock-yard boom. To them a chip of it was as<br/>
a piece of the Cross. Ignorant though they were of the secret facts<br/>
of the tragedy, and not thinking but that the penalty was some-<br/>
how unavoidably inflicted from the naval point of view, for all<br/>
that they instinctively felt that Billy was a sort of man as incapa-<br/>
ble of mutiny as of willful murder. They recalled the fresh young<br/>
image of the Handsome Sailor, that face never deformed by a<br/>
sneer or subtler vile freak of the heart within! This impression<br/>
of him was doubtless deepened by the fact that he was gone, <br/>
and in a measure mysteriously gone. On the gun-decks of the<br/>
Indomitable the general estimate of his nature and its unconscious<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
simplicity eventually found rude utterance from another foreto-<br/>
pman, one of his own watch, gifted as some sailors are with an art-<br/>
less poetic temperament. The tarry hands made some lines which<br/>
after circulating among the shipboard crew for a while finally got<br/>
rudely printed at Portsmouth as a ballad. The title given to it was<br/>
the sailor's.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good of the Chaplain to enter Lone BayAnd down on his marrow-bones here and prayFor the likes just o' me, Billy Budd.&mdash;But look:Through the port comes the moon-shine astray!It tips the guard's cutlass and silvers this nook;But &lsquo;twill die in the dawning of Billy's last day.A jewel-block they'll make of me to-morrow,Pendant pearl from the yard-arm-endLike the ear-drop I gave to Bristol Molly&mdash;O, 'tis me, not the sentence they'll suspendAy, Ay, all is up; and I must up tooEarly in the morning, aloft from alow. On an empty stomach, now, never it would do. They'll give me a nibble&mdash;bit o' biscuit ere I go.Sure, a messmate will reach me the last parting cup;But, turning heads away from the hoist and the belay,Heaven knows who will have the running of me up!No pipe to those halyards&mdash;but aren't it all sham?A blur's in my eyes; it is dreaming that I am.<br/>
<br/>
A hatchet to my panzer? all adrift to go?The drum roll to grog, and Billy never know?But Donald he has promised to stand by the plank;So I'll shake a friendly hand ere I sink.But&mdash;no! It is dead then I'll be, come to think.&mdash;I remember Taff the Welshman when he sank.And his cheek it was like the budding pink&lt;.&gt;But me they'll lash me in hammock, drop me deep.Fathoms down, fathoms down, how I'll dream fast asleep.I feel it stealing now. Sentry, are you there?Just ease these darbies at the wrist, And roll me over fair.I am sleepy, and the oozy weeds about me twist. End Of Book<br/>
